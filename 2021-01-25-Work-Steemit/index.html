        <h2 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h2><h3 id="E-Commerce-Presence-Look-Around"><a href="#E-Commerce-Presence-Look-Around" class="headerlink" title="E-Commerce Presence Look Around"></a>E-Commerce Presence Look Around</h3><p>I have worked in the intellectual property industry. This is a traditional industry, but it is also increasingly influenced by E-commerce, especially trademark registration and transaction, and blockchain will also revolutionize the industry in the future. So I have investigated an E-Commerce Presence in the intellectual property industry, which is Alibaba Cloud Trademark Service.</p>
<p>Alibaba Cloud Trademark Service is online, safe, efficient, convenient, and has a high pass rate compared to other traditional trademark agencies. Their smart trademark registration can be submitted to the Chinese Trademark Office (CTMO) in just 1 minute (tm.aliyun.com, 2020), and the progress of the application can be checked at any time. You can also quickly purchase millions of registered trademarks from the Platform. Alibaba also integrates blockchain technology into the intellectual property system of its global companies and brands. (ipp.alibabagroup.com, 2018) Ali Xizhi, the company’s intellectual property protection director, said that Alibaba establishes intellectual property platform base on blockchain to directly link the evidence to internet courts. (163.com, 2019) Moreover, the intellectual property on the chain will also be monitored to trigger content payment and transaction scenarios with the increase of data.</p>
<p>Currently, Alibaba Cloud Trademark Service provides Chinese trademark registration and transaction, the international application still not available such as the Madrid system. “Trademark prosecution in China is highly mechanical, there is no CTMO equivalent to a USPTO office action, no back-and-forth with trademark examiners, and no chance to amend an application that has been filed.” (news.alibaba.com, 2014) China still has much work to do in improving the construction of its intellectual property system, I think to link the Blockchain-Based E-commerce Platform like Alibaba with the CTMO can raise a more creative social environment.</p>

<h3 id="How-has-WeChat-grown-to-rival-Alipay-in-Mobile-payment-market-share-in-China"><a href="#How-has-WeChat-grown-to-rival-Alipay-in-Mobile-payment-market-share-in-China" class="headerlink" title="How has WeChat grown to rival Alipay in Mobile payment market share in China"></a>How has WeChat grown to rival Alipay in Mobile payment market share in China</h3><p>WeChat Pay became China’s second-largest mobile payment service to rival Alipay, because of “New Year Red Envelope” app’s viral success with focused on peer-to-peer payments offering and WeChat’s traffic and social advantage.</p>
<p>In 2015, WeChat introduced “New Year Red Envelope” app for Chinese New Year, and 1.2 billion red envelopes were sent during the promotion. (Vickie, 2015) The app is so convenient which became the new culture of virtual Red Envelope in China, (Chantal, 2016) and those features significantly increased the adoption of WeChat Pay. WeChat Pay relying on the WeChat’s massive users that have strong relationship chains to allow users to learn and spread spontaneously with this innovative form of payment.</p>
<p>Alipay’s escrow-based system is a financial cybermediary to build trust between buyers and sellers which goal is always to keep consumer’s money in their accounts. You have to pay Alipay first, and then order Alipay to pay the seller after confirming the receipt. This feature determines the advantages of “Tabao + Alipay” and the disadvantages of the complex payment process at that time. WeChat Pay started by focusing on peer-to-peer with the advantage of user experience in the payment process, and Alipay just can’t abandon the foundation of “Tabao + Alipay” to fight traffic with WeChat. After that, WeChat Pay not only relied on red envelopes to complete large-scale user accumulation, but also launched the QR code to O2O offline markets such as the street shops and food sellers, and offers some services beyond payments: loans, insurance, investment, and credit scores. WeChat Pay is positioned extremely well going forward with massive users. In terms of results, the iResearch Consulting Group estimates that WeChat Pay holds 39.5% market share as of Q3 2019, behind Alipay’s 54.5%. (Mansoor, 2020)</p>

<h3 id="A-Look-at-Tik-Tok"><a href="#A-Look-at-Tik-Tok" class="headerlink" title="A Look at Tik-Tok"></a>A Look at Tik-Tok</h3><p>Tik-Tok is the new revolution in social networking which was launched in 2017 and became the world’s top 7 social networks with 800 million monthly active users in 2020. (Statista.com, 2020) Tik-Tok is so successful because of their algorithm-first attention market significantly increases user engagement that encourages its users to showcase themselves and fuelling everybody’s creativity. However, Tik-Tok’s algorithm-first attention market is not only centrally ruled, but also centrally allocated, (John, 2019) and it is one of the reasons Tik-Tok is considered as a threat to national security from Trump Administration.</p>
<p>Why is Tik-Tok so popular? Tik-Tok’s algorithm mechanism is tantamount to be “the one who understands you most” for users, and they can get the videos of the user’s interest based on the user’s operation, habit, and browsing history. To be specific, Hashtags play a surprisingly large role in Tik-Tok, and the process is divided into three parts: labeling the video, labeling the user, and intelligently personalized push videos to the user. Users can easily learn from the interesting videos and created their own, and this makes Tik-Tok have increasingly higher user engagement than Facebook.</p>
<p>Trump Administration decided to ban Tik-Tok in the U.S, (Ana, 2020) and this is not unusual in other countries. (John, 2020) Ignore political factors, Tik-Tok relies heavily on AI and opaque centralized platforms which can cause unintended consequences and misuse. Those challenges are not only for Tik-Tok but also for Facebook, Twitter, etc. Through the decentralization of blockchain and privacy security management, it can be possible to improve data security risks and trust crises. Although “Ban Tik-Tok” is not just technical problems, I still believe the appropriate use of technology can influence a more democratic and civilization social environment.</p>

<h3 id="What-is-the-purpose-of-Puma’s-content-management-system"><a href="#What-is-the-purpose-of-Puma’s-content-management-system" class="headerlink" title="What is the purpose of Puma’s content management system"></a>What is the purpose of Puma’s content management system</h3><p>The purpose of Puma’s CMS is to provide a variety of content that is consistent with Puma branding and navigation for consumers on one central website and use the data from consumers interactive to improve the performance by estimate current business expansions and derive future strategy and investment decisions.</p>
<p>The lack of a standardized way to manage and publish product information is very inefficient for Puma to achieve agility. Heike Zenkel, Team Head Content Management Global E-Commerce at Puma explains: “With a 12-week product life cycle, speed, agility, and time to market are key for Puma, and we need to act fast before margins drop.” (Informatica.com, 2017) Puma builds a single centralized website to Unifying product information which can consistent Puma branding and navigation with a trusted view for global e-commerce. This also helps them to unify customer shopping experience and reduce duplicate work.</p>
<p>Puma implements Data-driven digital transformation to startups to become “the fastest sports brand in the world” (Antonia Renner, 2017). They were partnering with Viget to build a centralized website (Ben Adlard, 2011). Puma restructured systems base on their branded content strategy, and a new platform is launched to support their strategy in 2014. Through continuous e-commerce strategy development, and after Puma has gained invaluable omni-channel experience and implemented some solutions to support the regional teams’ daily operational and locality-based decision-making, such as Informatica MDM – Product 360, Informatica Data Quality, AutoStore inventory automation system, Business Process Management, Salesforce Commerce Cloud Accelerator, etc. Puma established excellent content management with these investments in systems that helped increase sales, higher customer conversion rates, improved operational efficiency, reduced data management costs, and reached ROI targets in less than 2 years (Informatica.com, 2017). As a results, Puma’s online business grows 15 times from 2012 to 2017 (Sneha Jha, 2017). Not only that, Puma re-launching to Mobile-First sites in July 2017, “its mobile sites now render and fully load 35% and 69% faster, respectively, resulting in sub-two second image-load times on the product detail page. Conversion has improved from sub 1% to 1-1.5%.” (Salesforce.com, 2019)</p>

<h2 id="2-Paid-Content-in-Blog-Steemit"><a href="#2-Paid-Content-in-Blog-Steemit" class="headerlink" title="2. Paid Content in Blog: Steemit"></a>2. Paid Content in Blog: Steemit</h2><p>In the old days, people could only spread their knowledge and skills through printed newspapers, books, magazines. Nowadays, anyone can start a blog to share knowledge on the Internet in the E-Commerce era. However, there is no doubt that copyright protection is the most controversial issue for paid content in the digital world, which is always inefficient and expensive because of the low cost of piracy. Some platforms like <em>rightknights.com</em> provide service for the issue, but still not easy to administer for bloggers. Some people discovered that blockchain technology is a natural fit to protect copyright, and it provides better evidence for the creation of blog posts. This chapter will study the Steemit, which is a blockchain-based blogging and social media platform, to analyze how it addresses the issue and discuss the challenge the community faced to find out a solution for paid content and digital copyright in Blockchain Era.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Current-Status-of-Digital-Copyright-for-Paid-Content"><a href="#2-1-Current-Status-of-Digital-Copyright-for-Paid-Content" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Current Status of Digital Copyright for Paid Content"></a>2.1 Current Status of Digital Copyright for Paid Content</h3><p>Nowadays, people simply read the news online and receive the same information in a much more efficient manner. CDs and print books are not indispensable in the digital age because there are many public platforms to choose from: Google, Facebook, YouTube, etc. On the other hand, online infringement is more unscrupulous due to its low cost and easy transmission, which means the process of copyright protection is more complicated than before. Therefore, digital copyright protection in the fragmented digital age is a very challenging subject.</p>
<p>Since digital publishing is an industry with technology development as its core, copyright protection is the core issue of its development[^blog1]. Nowadays, many publishers are reluctant to digitize their books, and the main reason is the fear of piracy in digital publishing. The problem of copyright protection has not been adequately addressed. Even if the industry itself has development potential, the publishing office can only stay away from digital publishing. Although DRM (Digital Rights Management), a systematic approach to copyright protection for digital media, prevents the use of unauthorized digital media, it is still inconvenient and expensive to form a universal and adequate digital copyright protection for blogging platform to apply[^blog2]. The core problem is the registration of copyright and the distribution of benefits.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Steemit-A-Blockchain-based-Blogging-Platform"><a href="#2-2-Steemit-A-Blockchain-based-Blogging-Platform" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Steemit - A Blockchain-based Blogging Platform"></a>2.2 Steemit - A Blockchain-based Blogging Platform</h3><p>Steemit is a very different digital platform, which is ad-free and allows authors to obtain revenue without the intermediary fee, as Wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steemit is designed as a decentralized application (DApp) built upon the Steem blockchain, using the eponymous cryptocurrency STEEM to reward users for their content. By voting on posts and comments, users get to decide the payout of those posts. Users also get so called “Curation Rewards” for finding and upvoting content that gets upvoted by other users afterwards. [^blog3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By studying the Steem white paper, the services provide members in the community five aspects: first, to discover articles and comments; second, to obtain high-quality answers to personal questions; third, to provide a stable cryptocurrency linked to the US dollar; fourth, no intermediary fee; fifth, provide other members with tasks related to the above services[^blog4]. Obviously, Steemit removes the middleman through the blockchain and combines paid content and digital copyright with social activity, so the author can directly obtain income in this blogging platform.</p>
<h4 id="2-2-1-Copyright-in-Steemit"><a href="#2-2-1-Copyright-in-Steemit" class="headerlink" title="2.2.1 Copyright in Steemit"></a>2.2.1 Copyright in Steemit</h4><p>Under the influence of the Web 2.0 sharing economy, the management process of personal digital content is complicated, including copyright confirmation, protection, and compensation. This phenomenon has spawned many profit-oriented copycats and significantly dampened the creative enthusiasm of copyright holders. The Steemit community is serious about copyright and originality. Users can publish the article on the Steem blockchain, which generates a immutable timestamp, transparent, credible evidence. Plagiarism on Steemit will be warned, punished, and even blacklisted by users in the community. The mechanism of copyright protection depends on community users with the reward system, unlike DRM (Digital Rights Management). For example, the witnesses of Steem or users can use robots to find the plagiarized article, then auto-comment the linked-article below it, and such articles will be downvote until inaccessible by readers.</p>
<p>Unlike other blogging platforms, Most articles in Steemit have numerous user comments below because of the reward system and tamper-proofing posting and commenting articles. Therefore, users usually see high-responsibility content and present a harmonious scene. Users know that the lack of responsibility will only scare away new users and make the price of Steem coins fall, which affects their self-interest and sees plagiarism nowhere to exist for digital copyright protection.</p>
<h4 id="2-2-2-Paid-Content-in-Steemit"><a href="#2-2-2-Paid-Content-in-Steemit" class="headerlink" title="2.2.2 Paid Content in Steemit"></a>2.2.2 Paid Content in Steemit</h4><p>The mechanism of paid content in Steemit is different from the advertising content platforms. There is no advertising, and users who comment or downvote the plagiarized article will get cryptocurrency rewards. Moreover, the valuable articles can also get cryptocurrency rewards by the upvote of other users. This mechanism provides authors to get paid from articles. Furthermore, it monitors and automates complex processes across the community for paid content.</p>

<p>Figure 1: The Conversion among Steem, Steem Power and Steem Dollar.[^blog5]</p>
<p>The Steemit reward system introduced three assets: Steem, Steem Power, and Steem Dollars, whose relationship and conversion are shown in Figure 1.[^blog5] Steem is the token of the entire system, similar to Bitcoin, which can trade on the exchanges. Users can get Steem Power rewards by writing valuable articles and comments on the Steemit or use Steem to buy it. Steem Dollar is a value stabilizer that is anchored at $1. Steemit is trying to make a fair scoring design for personal contribution content by those three assets. Steemit abandons the one-person-one-vote design of most platforms and instead of encouraging participants for long-term interest. More specifically, the Steemit reward algorithms follow a proof-of-stake to reach consensus, which is addressed to make a strong community, as Ned Scott affirmed in an interview for <em>coinreport.net</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we kept coming back to the idea that the most useful and powerful thing to leverage around a cryptocurrency is a community.[^blog6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The distribution of reward is establishing and evaluating content’s social value through Proof of Brain. The user’s Steem Power determines the weight of the user’s voting.[^blog13] The proportion of new cryptocurrency from the reward pool is distributed by users’ achievements, and allocate to witness, authors, curators, Steem Power holders, and other roles. There are three types of user rewards, including author reward, producer reward, and curation reward.[^blog11] Author rewards are correlated with several factors, including the number of followers and created posts, and Steem Power they have owned.</p>
<h4 id="2-2-3-The-business-model-of-Steemit"><a href="#2-2-3-The-business-model-of-Steemit" class="headerlink" title="2.2.3 The business model of Steemit"></a>2.2.3 The business model of Steemit</h4><p><img src="bmc_Steemit.png" alt="The Business Model of Steemit"></p>
<p>Table 1: The Business Model Canvas for Steemit.</p>
<p>The business model of Steemit is incredibly innovative. In Table 1, there are some descriptions in each part of the canvas and reasoned behind from a business perspective, based on the method from the book <em>Business Model Generation</em> by Alexander Osterwalder &amp; Yves Pigneur[^blog12]. The reward system determines perceptions of articles quality in Steemit by the value of Steem, which is the revenue of Steemit and users as for the community to grow.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-The-Challenge-that-Steemit-encountered"><a href="#2-3-The-Challenge-that-Steemit-encountered" class="headerlink" title="2.3 The Challenge that Steemit encountered"></a>2.3 The Challenge that Steemit encountered</h3><p>The Steemit blogging social platform base on the blockchain is a revolutionary trend in developing digital copyright and paid content, but there are also significant challenges. The distributed blockchain is transparent and credible, but it is only a technology. How to apply this technology to achieve a safe and reliable system is even more critical. Using the DPoS consensus in Steemit has some security risks and misuse of decentralization. The consensus has not reached the original intention of its design.</p>
<h4 id="2-3-1-Misuse-of-Reward-System"><a href="#2-3-1-Misuse-of-Reward-System" class="headerlink" title="2.3.1 Misuse of Reward System"></a>2.3.1 Misuse of Reward System</h4><p>The Steemit reward system lacks fairness in articles’ rewards and voting weights, making some users disappointed and leave forever. Steem Power is introducing the monetary quantification of identity value.[^blog4] Unfortunately, the power has no limit for big stakeholders who obtain most of the interest by holding a large number of Steem Powers that determine most of the wealth distribution. This unfair symptom makes a minority of users hold most of the power and wealth. Conversely, weak and poor users are less likely to protect their rights. Steemit, a decentralized community, lost the community’s original intention but became even more centralized because of the misuse of the reward system.</p>
<h4 id="2-3-2-Factors-Correlated-with-Problems"><a href="#2-3-2-Factors-Correlated-with-Problems" class="headerlink" title="2.3.2 Factors Correlated with Problems"></a>2.3.2 Factors Correlated with Problems</h4><p>Similarly, the benefit of “upvote” and “downvote” actions directly affect the quality of articles by the amount of Steem Power in Steemit.  Users who hold ten Steem Power is ten times of ability of judgment than one Steem Power, and the behavior of “upvote” directly determines the author’s income, which also brings many potential threats to a longer-term strategy for evolving its platform.[^blog11] At the beginning of the Steem development team, they were the original big stakeholders who separated the earliest Steem and converted it to Steem Power. According to the white paper[^blog4], 90% of the newly issued Steem cryptocurrency every year will be distributed to those who hold Steem Power, which means 90% of rewards assigned to these big stakeholders. Only 10% of rewards distributed to most of the users. Actually, the Steemit reward system followed the shareholder evaluation reward system rather than the user evaluated. This form leads to two problems: most of the wealth assigned to the few, and bad money drives out good.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-The-Solution-for-Steemit"><a href="#2-4-The-Solution-for-Steemit" class="headerlink" title="2.4 The Solution for Steemit"></a>2.4 The Solution for Steemit</h3><h4 id="2-4-1-The-Behavioral-Side-of-Solution"><a href="#2-4-1-The-Behavioral-Side-of-Solution" class="headerlink" title="2.4.1 The Behavioral Side of Solution"></a>2.4.1 The Behavioral Side of Solution</h4><p>In the previous section, by studying the challenges of Steemit, the main problem is that a minority of users gathered most of Steem Power in the reward system, which means the value of articles was not adequately evaluated, and the current electoral system lacked security, fairness and insufficient of decentralization. The behavioral side of solution is to reduce the gap between big stakeholders and ordinary stakeholders. Such as restrict the voting rights of large stakeholders to assess the value of articles and instead allow them to improve the quality of articles and copyright protection for regular stakeholders. Those top stakeholders should focus on the long-term benefits and build a multi-dimensional reward system for value evaluation and copyright protection.</p>
<h4 id="2-4-2-The-Technical-Side-of-Solution"><a href="#2-4-2-The-Technical-Side-of-Solution" class="headerlink" title="2.4.2 The Technical Side of Solution"></a>2.4.2 The Technical Side of Solution</h4><p>The technical side of solution is to improve the consensus protocol for the current reward system of Steemit. There are some issues of DPoS (Delegate Proof of Stake)[^blog7] to research before address the solution. In Figure 2, DPoS has solved the problem of untimely and inefficient use of rights and interests, which is getting the right people to do the right thing at the right time. It is an election of 21 stakeholders who take charge of the community in Steemit, and the community authorized those stakeholders, namely representatives, to select the next block. Obviously, the DPoS consensus algorithm has a defect in centralization, which means the entire blockchain is safe if and only if the majority of the elected representatives are trustworthy. However, Steemit still faces risks, even with hand-holding from an honest expert.[^blog8]</p>

<p>In 2014, the Tendermint team solved this problem through combined BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) and PoS.[^blog10] BFT brings considerable anti-risk capabilities to the distributed and decentralized network. The algorithm ensures security with most users’ honesty and makes it possible to reset the weight of Steem Power of witness in Steemit. In this way, there is no need to worry about big stakeholders harming the community with a small amount of money, and it is not profitable to control the community with much money. At the same time, witness election can be fairly performed by Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol through Verifiable Random Functions in cryptography, rather than by big stakeholders. Big stakeholders no longer control an article’s value assessment, but users in the entire community jointly maintain copyright protection and paid content.</p>
<h3 id="2-5-Conclution"><a href="#2-5-Conclution" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Conclution"></a>2.5 Conclution</h3><p>The problems of paid content and digital copyright is becoming more and more prominent in the information age. This report studied the case of Steemit and how blockchain technology change paid content and digital copyright. The blockchain-based Steemit can support copyright protection for authors to get paid through the reward system. Meanwhile, the Steemit community misused the reward system and discussed its solutions, including the behavioral and technical side.</p>
<p>Blockchain and decentralized application is becoming the trend for paid content and digital copyright protection. The development of those technologies results in productivity and social revolution changes, which redefines the relationship between people and resources. Paid content and digital copyright in the blockchain era are innovative for creators, and the original content ecology in this revolution is just starting. Paid content and digital copyright will become more mature to protect creators’ interests with the development and progress of e-commerce technology, community, and legal system.</p>
