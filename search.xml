2013)Notes Introduction: Data-Analytic Thinking Data science: a set of fundamental principles that guide the extraction of knowledge from data Churn: customers switching from one company to another DDD: Data-Driven Decition Making =by&gt; Data science involces principles, processes, and techniques for understanding phenomena via the (automated) analysis of data. data-driven-decision-making-notes.pdf Discovery Accuracy Big Data: datasets that are too large for traditional data processing systems Data, Data Science Capability as a Dtrategic Asset: the capability to extract useful knowledge from data Fundamental concept: Extracting useful knowledge from data to solve business problemscan be treated systematically by following a process with reasonably well-defined stages From a large mass of data, information technology can be used tofind informative descriptive attributes of entities of interest If you look too hard at a set of data, you will find something—butit might not generalize beyond the data you’re looking at Formulating data mining solutions and evaluating the resultsinvolves thinking carefully about the context in which they will be used Business Problems and Data Science Solutions Fundamentally different types of tasks data mining algorithms address: Classification and class probability estimation attempts to predict, for each individual in a population, which of a (small) set of classes this individual belongs to (binary target) scoring model applied to an individual produces a score representing the probability that that individual belongs to each class Regression (“value estimation”) attempts to estimate or predict, for each individual, the numerical value of some variable for that individual (numeric target) Similarity matching attempts to identify similar individuals based on data known about them Clustering attempts to group individuals in a population together by their similarity, but not driven by any specific purpose Co-occurrence grouping attempts to find associations between entities based on transactions involving them Profiling (behaviour description) attempts to characterize the typical behaviour of an individual, group, or population Link prediction attempts to predict connections between data items, usually by suggesting that a link should exist, and possibly also estimating the strength of the link Data reduction attempts to take a large set of data and replace it with a smaller set of data that contains much of the important information in the larger set Casual modelling attempts to understand what events or actions actually influence others Unsupervised: data mining problem when there is no clear target Supervised: data mining problem where a specific target is defined and there must be data on the target Label: the value for the target variable for an individual Data mining algorithms: supervised methods classification regression casual modelling similarity matching link prediction data reduction unsupervised clustering co-occurrence grouping profiling similarity matching link prediction data reduction The data mining process given by the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRSIP-DM): Business Understanding to understand the problem to be solved the design team should think carefully about the problem to be solved and about the use scenario (the analysts’ creativity plays a large role) Data Understanding to understand the strengths and limitations of the data because there rarely is there an exact match with the problem cost of data may vary (some data may be purchased, free, or doesn’t exist at all) Data Preparation conversing the data into forms that yield better results (removing or inferring missing values, converting data to different types) leakage must be considered carefully (a situation where a variable collected in historical data gives information on the target variable – information that appears in historical data but is not actually available when the decision has to be made) Modelling the output of modelling is some sort of model or pattern capturing regularities in the data Evaluation to assess the data mining results rigorously and to gain confidence that they are valid and reliable before moving on ensure that the model satisfies the original business goals evaluating the results includes both quantitative and qualitative assessments Deployment the results are put into real use in order to realize some return on investment Related analytic techniques: Statistics Database Querying Data Warehousing Regression Analysis Machine Learning and Data Mining Introduction to Predictive Modelling: From Correlation to Supervised Segmentation Model: a simplified representation of reality created to serve a purpose Predictive modelling: the primary purpose of the model is to estimate an unknown value Descriptive modelling: the primary purpose of the model is to gain insight into the underlying phenomenon or process Supervised learning: model creation where the model describes a relationship between a set of selected variables (attributes or features) and a predefined variable called the target variable Instance (feature vector): a set of attributes (fields, columns, variables, or features) Model induction: the creation of models Induction algorithm/learner: the procedure that creates the model from the data Training data/labelled data: the input data for the induction algorithm, used for inducing the model Supervised Segmentation &amp; Selecting Informative Attributes - Pure: homogeneous with respect to the target variable Entropy: a measure of disorder that can be applied to a set Information Gain (IG): measures the change in entropy due to any amount of new information being added Classification tree are one sort of tree-structured model probability estimation tree - Y/N regression tree - numeric Fitting a Model to Data Parameter learning/parametric modeling: tuning parameters so that the model fits the data as well modelling as possible Linear discriminant: linear functions (𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥 + 𝑏) that discriminates between the classes, and the function of the decision boundary is a linear combination – a weighted sum – of the attributes Support vector machine (SVM) First fit the fattest bar between the classes the linear discriminant will be the center line through the dashed parallel lines (margin) has hinge loss - “small” errors Regression via Mathematical Functions Loss functions - hinge loss, Zero-one loss absolute error Least squares regression: its very sensitive to the date, outlying data points can severely skew the resultant linear function Logistic regression f(x) is the model’s estimation of the log-odds that x belongs to the positive class Most important parts logistic regression Differences between classification trees and linear classifiers Neural networks: can be seen as a “stack” of models Overfitting and Its Avoidance Generalization - the property of a model or modelling process, whereby the model applies to data that were not used to build the model Overfitting - the tendency of data mining procedures to tailor models to the training data, at the expense of generalization to previously unseen data points There is a fundamental trade-off between model complexity and the possibility of overfitting. Fitting graph - shows the accuracy of a model as a function of complexity Estimate generalization performance by comparing the predicted values with the hidden true values. Holdout data - data not used in building the model, but for which we do know the actual value of the target variable Generally, there will be more overfitting as one allows the model to be more complex. One way mathematical functions can become more complex is by adding more variables (more attributes) or changing the function from being truly linear to nonlinear. Overfitting is bad because as a model gets more complex it is allowed to pick up harmful spurious correlations. The harm occurs when these spurious correlations produce incorrect generalizations in the model. A holdout set gives us an estimate of generalization performance. Cross-validation - a more sophisticated holdout training and testing procedure Cross-validation begins by splitting a labelled dataset into k partitions called folds. The purpose of cross-validation is to use the original labelled data efficiently to estimate the performance of a modelling procedure. The result is k-different accuracy results, which then can be used to compute the average accuracy and its variance. Learning curve - a plot of the generalization performance against the amount of training data A learning curve shows the generalization performance – the performance only on testing data, plotted against the amount of training data used. A fitting graph shows the generalization performance as well as the performance on the training data, but plotted against model complexity. Tree induction uses two techniques to avoid overfitting: stop growing the tree before it gets too complex the threshold can be determined using a hypothesis test. grow the tree until it is too large, then “prune” it back, reducing its size (and thereby its complexity) The general method for avoiding overfitting is to choose the value for some complexity parameter by using some sort of nested holdout procedure. Sequential forward selection (SFS) - uses a nested holdout procedure to first pick the best individual feature, by looking at all models built using just one feature Regularization - a combination of fit to the data and simplicity of the model Similarity, Neighbors, and Clusters Similarity and Distance (Nearest-Neighbor Reasoning) nearest-neighbor methods often use weighted voting or imilarity moderated voting instance-based learning Case-Based Reasoning Geometric Interpretation, Overfitting, and Complexity Control k-NN e.g. k = n | k = 1 Issues with Nearest-Neighbor Methods Intelligibility Dimensionality and domain knowledge Technical Details - Calculating Scores from Neighbors Heterogeneous Attributes Manhattan distance or L1-norm Jaccard distance Cosine distance - text classification edit distance or the Levenshtein metric Majority vote classification Majority scoring function Similarity-moderated classification Similarity-moderated scoring Similarity-moderated regression Clustering Hierarchical Clustering - e.g. Tree of Life Clustering Around Centroids - k-means clustering Using Supervised Learning to Generate Cluster Descriptions CRISP data mining process Decision Analytic Thinking I: What Is a Good Model?

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[本文是针对《朝着有意义的参与——游戏化信息系统设计和研究的一个框架（Toward Meaningful Engagement: A Framework for Design and Research of Gamified Information Systems）》的论文解析，该论文于2017年12月发表在MIS Quarterly上。研究作者有三位，分别是De liu, Radhika Santhanam &amp; Jane Webster。 在信息系统中加入一些游戏设计的元素，可以使单调的任务变得有趣，让使用者的参与程度更高，从而提高组织的绩效。这种信息系统游戏化的现象变得越来越普遍，例如DirectTV公司使用如分数、比赛等游戏机制来激发IT部门800个员工的培训兴趣。Quora、Stackoverflow、Coursera等互联网平台使用游戏化设计来激励用户生产内容。2011年Burke报告表明，全球2000个组织有至少一个游戏化应用的占到70%。 尽管游戏化增长的趋势很高，但是一些失败的游戏化尝试也开始显现，如迪士尼乐园为了激励员工，在公共显示屏显示排行榜，绿色员工号码代表高效率，红色则表示低效。许多员工讨厌这样，觉得自己处于控制之中，把这种方式称作为“电子皮鞭”。失败的游戏化尝试表明，不是只在电子化任务中加入PBL（分数、徽章和排行榜）就可以带来令人满意的结果。 那么我们需要思考的问题是，好的游戏化设计和坏的游戏化设计区别是什么？游戏化设计的有效性如何评估？哪些理论可以指导好的游戏化设计？ 作者从游戏化的概念出发，综述了不同研究者对“游戏化”的概念，然后给出了游戏化（gamification）的定义：在目标系统中融入游戏设计的元素，并保持目标系统的工具性功能（instrumental function）。游戏化需要运用游戏化设计元素，作者认为包含两大类：游戏化对象（gamification objects）和游戏化机制（gamification mechanics）。 接着作者提出了一个游戏化设计和研究的框架，作者认为一个有意义的参与包括体验性结果和工具性结果，用户和系统之间的交互是游戏化元素和用户行为之间共同作用的结果，游戏化设计元素的选择依赖于用户、任务和技术平台，必须与目标相匹配。 接着，作者给出了游戏化设计的六大原则： 原则A：任务一致性原则（task congruence principle），游戏化设计元素必须同目标任务一致。 原则B：个性化原则（personalization principle），游戏化设计元素必须匹配用户的特点。 原则C：技术能力原则（technology affordance principle），游戏化设计元素必须同目标系统的技术相适应。 原则D：动态原则（dynamism principle），游戏化设计元素必须同所需的用户和系统间的交互相匹配。 原则E：重现原则（recurrence principle ），游戏化设计元素必须同期待的系统再次使用相匹配。 原则F：有意义的参与—双结果原则（meaning engagement：the dual-outcome principle ），为了在游戏化系统中产生有意义的参与，增强的体验性结果应该与更高水平的工具性结果相联系。 原则A：任务一致性原则（task congruence principle），游戏化设计元素必须同目标任务一致。 原则B：个性化原则（personalization principle），游戏化设计元素必须匹配用户的特点。 原则C：技术能力原则（technology affordance principle），游戏化设计元素必须同目标系统的技术相适应。 原则D：动态原则（dynamism principle），游戏化设计元素必须同所需的用户和系统间的交互相匹配。 原则E：重现原则（recurrence principle ），游戏化设计元素必须同期待的系统再次使用相匹配。 原则F：有意义的参与—双结果原则（meaning engagement：the dual-outcome principle ），为了在游戏化系统中产生有意义的参与，增强的体验性结果应该与更高水平的工具性结果相联系。 最后，作者建议信息系统（IS）领域的学者采用不同的理论和方法，来研究信息系统游戏化这一现象，进而增进对人类动机和行为的理解。 这是一篇研究评论（research commentary）文章，作者分析了信息系统游戏化这一现象，进而提出了一个游戏化设计和研究的框架和原则，这一现象的研究涉及经济学、管理学、计算机科学、心理学、工程学、人机交互和系统设计等学科的知识。拥有交叉学科背景知识的IS学者在信息系统游戏化现象的研究上可以说大有用武之地，但是恰恰IS学者对于这一现象研究不太够，因此作者指出IS学者可以采用不同理论和方法来研究信息游戏化现象，增进我们对于人类动机和行为的理解。]]></content>

From Questions to Sources To write a research report, you need to make a claim, back it up with reasons, support them with evidence, acknowledge and respond to alternatives, and sometimes, explain ur principles of reasoning. (the connection between claim and reason/warrenting the relevence of your reasons) Preparing to Draft, Drafting, &amp; Revising Write title by using Keyword Markdown论文笔记框架 12345678910111213141516171819# Title## Summary - 写完笔记之后最后填，概述文章的内容，以后查阅笔记的时候先看这一段, 忌讳直接Ctrl + c原文## Research Objective - 作者的研究目标## Problem Statement - 问题陈述，要解决什么问题## Method(s) - 解决问题的方法/算法是什么## Evaluation - 作者如何评估自己的方法，有没有问题或者可以借鉴的地方## Conclusion - 作者给了哪些strong conclusion, 又给了哪些weak conclusion## Notes - 在这些框架外额外需要记录的笔记## Part 1: Research, Researchers, &amp; Readers### Chap. 1 – Thinking in Print: The Uses of Research, Public &amp; Private What is Research? Gathering information needed to answer a question Who does research? Most of us do (informal) research every day Why do research? Research by others determines most of what each of us believes about the world Why write it up? To remember To understand To gain perspective Why turn it into a formal paper? (and learn new rules for presenting the information?) It will give you new ways of thinking Since it is more demanding to write for other, your ideas and connections among them will be clearer Chap. 2 – Connecting with Your Readers: (Re-)Creating Your Self and Your Audience Conversations among researchers: Research papers and “term” papers areconversations You must be aware of your audience What type of relationship do you want with them? You get to create a “role” for yourself and your reader Think about your readers: We know things about them: they have their own interests and preconceived ideas Is your question is a “live” issue in your community or readers? Where do your readers stand in respect to your answer? What do you expect of your readers: accept new knowledge change beliefs perform an action Writers and their common problems: Experts have the same problems as novices, but are better equipped Be aware uncertainties will arise Master your topic by writing about it along the way Control the complexities of your task Count on your teacher to understand your struggles Keep at it Part 2: Asking Questions, Finding Answers Three keys for working in groups: Talk together a lot Agree to disagree, then to agree Organize yourself into a team with a leader Three strategies for working in groups: Divide, delegate, &amp; conquer Write side-by-side Take turns Chap. 3 – From Topics to Questions The process of choosing what to research: Interests: Choose an interest in a broad subject area Topics: Narrow the interest to a plausible topic Questions: Question that topic from several points of view Problems: Define a rationale for your project Each step requires getting more specific. There are four perspectives on research topics that can help you narrow your interest to a research question: Identify the parts and whole of your topic and questions Trace the history and changes of your topic Identify its categories and characteristics Determine its value Making the case for the significance of a research question: Name your topic Suggest a question Motivate the question Chap. 4 - From Questions to ProblemsThe research cycle:Practical problems lead to research problems, and the answers are intended to help solve the practical problems. Practical problems: originate in the world Are based on some cost to society Are solved by taking action in the real world Research problems: originate in your mind Are based on incomplete knowledge or flawed understanding Are solved by gathering useful information Applied Research: The rationale for the research defines what youwish to DO The consequences of the research are tangible The research is “applied” because knowledge gained will be applied to solve an immediate practical problem “Pure” Research: The rationale for the research defines what you wish to KNOW The consequences of the research are conceptual The research is “pure” because knowledge is pursued for its own sake Chap. 5 - From Questions to SourcesThree types of sources: Primary: Materials that you are directly writing about; data Secondary: Books and articles in which others report their research Tertiary: Books and articles that describe or synthesize the research of others Chap. 6 – Using Sources Using secondary sources: One good source is worth more than dozens of mediocre sources One accurate summary of a good source is worth more than the source itself Read critically: Evaluate your sources Take full notes Get complete bibliographical information Get attributions right Get the context right Get help – ask others to review your ideas and writing Part 3: Making a Claim and Supporting ItChap. 7 - Making Good Arguments 4 components: Claims - what the reader is asked to accept (believe) Evidence - why Warrants - why the evidence is (necessary &amp;) sufficient Qualifications - limits on the claims Qualifications - (pay me now or pay me later) can qualify in the hypotheses can qualify after evidence doesn’t fully support the hypotheses Chap. 8 - Claims and EvidenceAnticipate the “So What?!” question The nature of claims - must be . . . (or readers will dismiss . . .) substantive contestable (non-intuitive, requires convincing) specific The nature of evidence - must be . . . (or readers will dismiss . . .) accurate at right level of detail (precision) sufficient representative (properly generalizable) authoritative (methods, literature citations, constructs, etc.) perspicuity (clear; plainly understood due to clarity of presentation; the proper level of detail/explanation) Evidence is esp. Important because readers predisposed to reject your claims will question your evidence carefully. OUTLINE YOUR ARGUMENT ! Chapter 9 - Warrants Warrants: if X then Y Warrants - 3 criteria: describe the (general kind of) evidence describe the general kind of claim that follows describe the connection (cause/effect, correlation, intervening) Clear thinking required !!! false warrants unclear warrants inappropriate warrants inapplicable warrants Chap. 10 - QualificationsBe Reasonable! (In your claims) anticipate and address objections concede (if you can’t rebut) stipulate limiting conditions limit the scope and certainty of claims &amp; evidence Part 4: Preparing to Draft, Drafting, &amp; RevisingChap. 11 - Pre-Drafting and Drafting It’s easy to put off writing. But if you write as you go (as you read, organize, and plan) starting the first draft is much easier. You know you are ready to start the first draft if you have thought about: Your major research question A possible answer A body of evidence to support the answer The major warrants The objections you will have to rebut The objections you cannot rebut A plan for drafting: Write out your main point, then determine where to put it (typically, the last sentence of your introduction) Formulate a “working” introduction (but plan to write a final version of the introduction LAST!) Follow the intro with the information needed for readers to understand the rest of the paper Rework your outline. Try different approaches. Reliable approaches include: old to new shorter &amp; simpler to longer &amp; more complex uncontested to more contested Some people write “quick &amp; dirty” drafts, others need to write “slow &amp; clean,” perfecting the paper sentence by sentence. Quick &amp; dirty writing has several advantages: Going with the flow; getting ideas down as you think of them (not stopping to fix spelling and sentence structure) When the flow stops, you have other tasks to do Pitfalls to avoid at all costs: Straightforward plagiarism of words (quote the source!) Straightforward plagiarism of ideas (cite the source!) Indirect plagiarism of words (changing a few words is still plagiarism!) Become aware you are plagiarizing. One test: if your eyes are on the source work, not your paper or computer screen, as you type - you are probably plagiarizing The biggest difference between good and poor writing is the attitude about the first draft: poor writers see the first draft as a triumph – they are near the end! Good writers see the first draft as a sketch – now comes the equally important work of refining the paper Chap. 12 - Communicating Evidence VisuallyNo summary is provided here since it requires accompanying examples. Please see the text. Chap. 13 - Revising Your Organization and ArgumentAgain, keep the reader in mind. More important than punctuation and spelling is the big picture: how well do the major elements fit together? Does it tell a complete story? Four steps in analyzing and revising the organization of the paper: Identify sentences that clearly summarize your introduction, conclusion, and main claim Identify the major sections of the paper and the “main point” sentences for each Identify in the introduction your central concepts and be sure you’ve focused on them throughout Step back to examine the overall shape of your paper Revising your argument: Identify your argument Evaluate the quality of your argument Is the evidence clearly connected to your claim? Have you qualified your argument? Do you provide reasons and anticipate objections? What warrants have you left unexpressed? (What else must the readers believe before they accept your claims?) Chap. 14 - Revising Style: Telling Your Story ClearlyThree principles of clear writing: Stories and grammars (advice about making sentence subjects the main “characters” in your paper, avoid “nominalizing” verbs, etc.) Old before new (present new information after familiar information) Complexity last (present simple information before complex information) Chap. 15 - IntroductionsThe structure of a good introduction: Provide context for your ideas State the problem Incomplete knowledge about some topic The consequences of that incomplete knowledge Provide a solution or response to the problem This is your main point and main claim Some noteszhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/69356185reading.geek-docs.com/social-sciences/the-research-is-an-art.htmlwww.jianshu.com/p/e38b65a9d327]]></content>

It has 5 objective: quality, Speed, Dependability, Flexibility, Cost. Differents: Operations strategy is long-term, Macro, Aggregated and Philosophical, and it should be appropriate, comprehensive, coherent, Consistent over time. Process design and product/service design are interrelated. Design helps businesses connect strongly with their customers by anticipating their real needs. Supply network design. Fixed-position layout, Functional layout, Cell layout and Product layout. Job design and work organization, Work measurement in job design, behavioural approaches to job design. Planning and control, Planning concerns what should happen in the future. Control copes with changes. Capacity planning and control, Measuring demand and capacity Inventory planning and control. Economic order quantity (EOQ): The quantity of items to order that supposedly minimizes the total cost of inventory management, derived from various EOQ formulae. Economic batch quantity (EBQ): The amount of items to be produced by a machine or process that supposedly minimizes the costs associated with production and inventory holding. Supply chain planning and control, A supply network is all the operations linked together to provide goods and services. Enterprise resource planning (ERP): The integration of all significant resource planning systems in an organization that, in an operations context, integrates planning and control with the other functions of the business. Lean operations: It means moving towards the elimination of all waste in order to develop anoperation that is faster, more dependable, produces higher-quality products and services, and, above all, operates at low cost.Just-in-time (JIT): A method of planning and control and an operations philosophy that aimsto meet demand instantaneously with perfect quality and no waste. 3 core functions: Marketing function (communicating) Product/service development function (creating) Operations function (fulfilling) Support functions: The accounting and finance function The human resources function Inputs to the process: Transformed resources: Materials (shape, composition) Information Customers (hairdressers) Transforming resources: Facilities Staff]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2018-01-25-Book-PythonDataAnalysisMining%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[按照书上的实例尝试学习，目前缺乏对这方面的实际业务需求，先做了解吧！ Python之所以能够成为数据分析与挖掘领域的最佳语言，是有其独特的优势的。因为他有很多这个领域相关的库可以用，而且很好用，比如Numpy、SciPy、Matploglib、Pandas、ScikitLearn、Keras、Gensim等，下面简单介绍下： Numpy，它给Python提供了真正的数组功能，包括多维数组，以及对数据进行快速处理的函数，Numpy还是更多高级扩展库的依赖库，比如后续的Scipy、Matplotlib、Pandas等，都一样； Scipy，他让Python成了半个MATLAB，Scipy提供了真正的矩阵类型，及其大量基于矩阵运算的对象和函数，他包括的功能包括最优化、线性代数、积分、插值、你和、特殊函数、快速傅里叶变换、信号处理与图像处理、常微分求解方程和其他科学与工程中常用的计算；Scipy依赖于Numpy； Matplotlib，对于Python来说，Matplotlib是最著名的绘图库，主要是二维绘图，当然，也可以支持一些简答的三围绘图； Pandas，他是Python下最强大的数据分析和探索工具，没有之一。他包含的高级的数据结构和精巧的工具，使得在Python中处理数据非常快速和简单，Pandas构建在NumPy之上，他使得以Numpy为中心的应用很容易使用，Pandas的名称来自于面板数据（Panel Data）和Python数据分析（Data Analysis），他最初被作为金融数据分析工具而开发出来，由AQR Capital Management公司于2008年4月开发出来，并与2009年底开源；他的功能非常强大，支持类似于SQL的数据增删改查，并且带有丰富的数据处理函数，支持时间序列分析，支持灵活处理确实数据等。Pandas其实很复杂， 够单独写一本书，如果对他有兴趣可以看看Pandas主要作者之一 WesMcKinney写的《利用Python进行数据分析》一书。 StatModels，Pandas着眼于数据的读取、处理和探索，而StatsModels则更加注重数据的统计建模和分析，他使得Python有了R语言的味道。StatModels支持与Pandas的数据交互，因此，他与Pandas结合，成为了Python下强大的数据挖掘组合； Scikit-Learn，这是一个和机器学习有关的库，他是Python下强大的及其学习工具包，他提供了完善的及其学习工具箱，包括：数据预处理、分类、回归、聚类、预测和模型分析等。他依赖于NumPy、SciPy、Matplotlib等； Keras，他是用来搭建神经网络的，他并非简单的神经网络库，而是一个基于Theano的强大的深度学习库，利用它不仅仅可以搭建普通的神经网络，还可以搭建各种深度学习模型，如自编码器、循环神经网络、递归神经网络、卷积神经网络等。由于它是基于Theano的，速度相当快。 Theano，他也是一个Python库，他是由深度学习专家YoshuaBengio带领的实验室开发出来的，用来定义、优化和高效地解决多维数组对应数学表达式的模拟估计问题。他具有高效地实现符号分解、高度优化的速度、和稳定性等特点，最重要的是还实现了GPU加速，是的密集型数据的处理速度是CPU的十倍； Gensim，topic modelling of humans，他主要用来处理语言方面的任务，如文本相似度计算、LDA、Word2Vec等，这些领域的任务往往需要比较多的背景知识，通常的情况是：研究这方面的读者已经不需要我再多说什么，而不研究这方面的读者，在这里也说不清楚。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[传统管理的问题VUCA不可预测性，不确定性，复杂性，模糊性这些问题如下所示： 信任和透明度 成本管理 控制 目标设置 绩效评估 奖金 节奏 质量 效率 记者兼作家大卫希洛塔是这样认为的：管理的主要问题不在于如何激励，而是如何阻止管理制度削减或毁灭动力。–个人奖金制度绝对是可以破坏动力的 德意志银行CEO约翰克莱恩这样说：我不知道为什么我入职合同附有奖金，因为我能够答应你，我在任何一年，任何一天，不会因为有人付给我更多或更少，而因此更加努力或更少努力工作 组织的“绩效管理”类似于交通信号灯的管理方式——严格、固定、基于规章制度的控制系统。 交通环岛的方式更像是“基于价值”的管理方式——交通部门现场“授权”给驾驶员，让他们根据实际情况及时有效决策；并提供充分的“透明度”，保证驾驶员能看到全面的交通情况。 超越预算本书是作者在工作中重新定义管理的实践，一个组织的规划和预算流程体现了它的管理原则和价值观。 相对目标应该代替绝对目标。 管理流程的节奏应该由事件驱动。 每个事件，从目标的设定到预测和资源分配，应该基于业务节奏而不是基于财年的年度节奏。 整体绩效评估应该代替单一、机械式的测量。 超越预算原则超越预算的基础原则：六个领导力原则和六个管理流程。 领导力原则（be Beyond Budgeting. 目的：围绕大胆而崇高的事业来吸引和激励人，而不是围绕着短期财务目标。 价值观：通过共同的价值观和正确的判断来治理，而不是通过详细的规章制度。 透明度：为自律、创新、学习和控制而开放信息，而不是限制信息。 组织：培养强烈的归属感，组织结构围绕着敏捷、有责任感的团队，避免分层控制和官僚作风。 自主权：信任团队，让团队成员自由行事，即使有人滥用自主权，也不要因此而惩罚所有人。 客户：将每个人的工作与客户的需求挂钩，避免利益冲突。 管理流程（do Beyond Budgeting. 节奏：管理流程动态的围绕业务的节奏，而不只限于围绕财年的节奏。 目标：设置有方向、有抱负、相对的目标；避免固定的、多个层级级联的目标。 规划与预测：使规划和预测过程既精益又公正，而不是一个僵化的、政治化的动作。 资源分配：培养成本意识的心态，按需提供资源，而不是通过详细的年度预算分配。 绩效评估：全面绩效评估，并为学习和发展提供同级反馈，而不仅仅是急于衡量标准，也不仅仅是为了奖励。 奖励：激励共同战胜竞争对手的成功，而不是针对固定的业绩评估合同。 需要注意的是：各个原则的相对重要性在具体情况中有很大区别，需要量体裁衣和渐进性的方式。 超越预算的六个要素超越预算被认为是信息化时代企业管理的重要方法，它的成功取决于以下六个方面 有足够数量的高素质人才; 具有企业成长与改善所必须的、富有创新能力的战略; 高效的决策机制; 顾客服务的及时性和灵活性; 能够正确估计自身存在的威胁和机会; 不断提高产品质量和满足顾客需求。 超越预算的配套措施为此，企业组织应当做好以下几方面的配套措施 尽可能压缩企业的管理层级; 实施决策权限和责任的委托; 创造企业新业务概念(新构想)的动力; 灵活应用企业的竞争优势 确保和维持最佳顾客; 通过完善服务和降低成本来满足顾客需求; 倡导管理者从所有者的视角去思考问题; 持续地为股东创造价值; 及时应对不断增加的不确定性，培养勇于承担风险的企业文化氛围; 具有完成目标的坚强信念; 制定明确的业绩责任的说明制度; 不断追求企业利益。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[人工智能的诞生：1943 - 1956IBM 702:第一代AI研究者使用的电脑.在20世纪40年代和50年代，来自不同领域（数学，心理学，工程学，经济学和政治学）的一批科学家开始探讨制造人工大脑的可能性。1956年，人工智能被确立为一门学科。 控制论与早期神经网络最初的人工智能研究是30年代末到50年代初的一系列科学进展交汇的产物。神经学研究发现大脑是由神经元组成的电子网络，其激励电平只存在“有”和“无”两种状态，不存在中间状态。维纳的控制论描述了电子网络的控制和稳定性。克劳德·香农提出的信息论则描述了数字信号（即高低电平代表的二进制信号）。图灵的计算理论证明数字信号足以描述任何形式的计算。这些密切相关的想法暗示了构建电子大脑的可能性。 游戏AI1951年，Christopher Strachey使用曼彻斯特大学的Ferranti Mark 1机器写出了一个西洋跳棋（checkers）程序；Dietrich Prinz则写出了一个国际象棋程序。亚瑟·山谬尔（Arthur Samuel）在五十年代中期和六十年代初开发的国际象棋程序的棋力已经可以挑战具有相当水平的业余爱好者。游戏AI一直被认为是评价AI进展的一种标准。 图灵测试1950年，图灵发表了一篇划时代的论文，文中预言了创造出具有真正智能的机器的可能性。由于注意到“智能”这一概念难以确切定义，他提出了著名的图灵测试：如果一台机器能够与人类展开对话（通过电传设备）而不能被辨别出其机器身份，那么称这台机器具有智能。这一简化使得图灵能够令人信服地说明“思考的机器”是可能的。论文中还回答了对这一假说的各种常见质疑。图灵测试是人工智能哲学方面第一个严肃的提案。 符号推理与“逻辑理论家”程序50年代中期，随着数字计算机的兴起，一些科学家直觉地感到可以进行数字操作的机器也应当可以进行符号操作，而符号操作可能是人类思维的本质。这是创造智能机器的一条新路。 1956年达特茅斯会议：AI的诞生1956年达特矛斯会议的组织者是马文·闵斯基，约翰·麦卡锡和另两位资深科学家克劳德·香农以及内森·罗彻斯特（Nathan Rochester），后者来自IBM。会议提出的断言之一是“学习或者智能的任何其他特性的每一个方面都应能被精确地加以描述，使得机器可以对其进行模拟。” 与会者包括雷·索罗门诺夫（Ray Solomonoff），奥利佛·塞尔弗里奇（Oliver Selfridge），Trenchard More，亚瑟·山谬尔（Arthur Samuel），艾伦·纽厄尔和赫伯特·西蒙，他们中的每一位都将在AI研究的第一个十年中作出重要贡献。会上纽厄尔和西蒙讨论了“逻辑理论家”，而麦卡锡则说服与会者接受“人工智能”一词作为本领域的名称。1956年达特矛斯会议上AI的名称和任务得以确定，同时出现了最初的成就和最早的一批研究者，因此这一事件被广泛承认为AI诞生的标志。 黄金年代：1956 - 1974达特茅斯会议之后的数年是大发现的时代。对许多人而言，这一阶段开发出的程序堪称神奇：计算机可以解决代数应用题，证明几何定理，学习和使用英语。当时大多数人几乎无法相信机器能够如此“智能”。 研究者们在私下的交流和公开发表的论文中表达出相当乐观的情绪，认为具有完全智能的机器将在二十年内出现。 DARPA（国防高等研究计划署）等政府机构向这一新兴领域投入了大笔资金。 搜索式推理许多AI程序使用相同的基本算法。为实现一个目标（例如赢得游戏或证明定理），它们一步步地前进，就像在迷宫中寻找出路一般；如果遇到了死胡同则进行回溯。这就是“搜索式推理”。这一思想遇到的主要困难是，在很多问题中，“迷宫”里可能的线路总数是一个天文数字（所谓“指数爆炸”）。研究者使用启发式算法去掉那些不太可能导出正确答案的支路，从而缩小搜索范围。 一个语义网的例子自然语言: AI研究的一个重要目标是使计算机能够通过自然语言（例如英语）进行交流。早期的一个成功范例是Daniel Bobrow的程序STUDENT，它能够解决高中程度的代数应用题。Joseph Weizenbaum的ELIZA是第一个聊天机器人，可能也是最有趣的会说英语的程序。与ELIZA“聊天”的用户有时会误以为自己是在和人类，而不是和一个程序，交谈。但是实际上ELIZA根本不知道自己在说什么。它只是按固定套路作答，或者用符合语法的方式将问题复述一遍。 微世界60年代后期，麻省理工大学AI实验室的马文·闵斯基和西摩尔·派普特建议AI研究者们专注于被称为“微世界”的简单场景。他们指出在成熟的学科中往往使用简化模型帮助基本原则的理解，例如物理学中的光滑平面和完美刚体。许多这类研究的场景是“积木世界”，其中包括一个平面，上面摆放着一些不同形状，尺寸和颜色的积木。微世界程序的最高成就是Terry Winograd的SHRDLU，它能用普通的英语句子与人交流，还能作出决策并执行操作。 乐观思潮第一代AI研究者们曾作出了如下预言:1958年，艾伦·纽厄尔和赫伯特·西蒙：“十年之内，数字计算机将成为国际象棋世界冠军。” “十年之内，数字计算机将发现并证明一个重要的数学定理。”1965年，赫伯特·西蒙：“二十年内，机器将能完成人能做到的一切工作。”1967年，马文·闵斯基：“一代之内……创造‘人工智能’的问题将获得实质上的解决。”1970年，马文·闵斯基：“在三到八年的时间里我们将得到一台具有人类平均智能的机器。” 第一次AI低谷：1974 - 1980到了70年代，AI开始遭遇批评，随之而来的还有资金上的困难。AI研究者们对其课题的难度未能作出正确判断：此前的过于乐观使人们期望过高，当承诺无法兑现时，对AI的资助就缩减或取消了。同时，由于马文·闵斯基对感知器的激烈批评，联结主义（即神经网络）销声匿迹了十年。70年代后期，尽管遭遇了公众的误解，AI在逻辑编程，常识推理等一些领域还是有所进展。 问题70年代初，AI遭遇了瓶颈。即使是最杰出的AI程序也只能解决它们尝试解决的问题中最简单的一部分，也就是说所有的AI程序都只是“玩具”。AI研究者们遭遇了无法克服的基础性障碍。尽管某些局限后来被成功突破，但许多至今仍无法满意地解决。 停止拨款由于缺乏进展，对AI提供资助的机构（如英国政府，DARPA和NRC）对无方向的AI研究逐渐停止了资助。早在1966年ALPAC（Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee，自动语言处理顾问委员会）的报告中就有批评机器翻译进展的意味，预示了这一局面的来临。NRC（National Research Council，美国国家科学委员会）在拨款二千万美元后停止资助。1973年Lighthill针对英国AI研究状况的报告批评了AI在实现其“宏伟目标”上的完全失败，并导致了英国AI研究的低潮（该报告特别提到了指数爆炸问题，以此作为AI失败的一个原因）。DARPA则对CMU的语音理解研究项目深感失望，从而取消了每年三百万美元的资助。到了1974年已经很难再找到对AI项目的资助。 来自大学的批评一些哲学家强烈反对AI研究者的主张。其中最早的一个是John Lucas，他认为哥德尔不完备定理已经证明形式系统（例如计算机程序）不可能判断某些陈述的真理性，但是人类可以。修伯特·德雷福斯（Hubert Dreyfus）讽刺六十年代AI界那些未实现的预言，并且批评AI的基础假设，认为人类推理实际上仅涉及少量“符号处理”，而大多是具体的，直觉的，下意识的“窍门（know how）”。 约翰·希尔勒于1980年提出“中文房间”实验，试图证明程序并不“理解”它所使用的符号，即所谓的“意向性（intentionality）”问题。希尔勒认为，如果符号对于机器而言没有意义，那么就不能认为机器是在“思考”。 感知器与联结主义遭到冷落感知器是神经网络的一种形式，由Frank Rosenblatt于1958年提出。与多数AI研究者一样，他对这一发明的潜力非常乐观，预言说“感知器最终将能够学习，作出决策和翻译语言”。整个六十年代里这一方向的研究工作都很活跃。1969年Minsky和Papert出版了著作《感知器》，书中暗示感知器具有严重局限，而Frank Rosenblatt的预言过于夸张。这本书的影响是破坏性的：联结主义的研究因此停滞了十年。后来新一代研究者使这一领域获得重生，并使其成为人工智能中的重要部分；遗憾的是Rosenblatt没能看到这些，他在《感知器》问世后不久即因游船事故去世。 “简约派（the neats）”：逻辑，Prolog语言和专家系统早在1958年，John McCarthy就提出了名为“纳谏者（Advice Taker）”的一个程序构想，将逻辑学引入了AI研究界。1963年，J. Alan Robinson发现了在计算机上实现推理的简单方法：归结（resolution）与合一（unification）算法。然而，根据60年代末McCarthy和他的学生们的工作，对这一想法的直接实现具有极高的计算复杂度：即使是证明很简单的定理也需要天文数字的步骤。70年代Robert Kowalsky在Edinburgh大学的工作则更具成效：法国学者Alain Colmerauer和Phillipe Roussel在他的合作下开发出成功的逻辑编程语言Prolog。 “芜杂派（the scruffies）”：框架和脚本对McCarthy的做法持批评意见的还有他在MIT的同行们。马文·闵斯基，Seymour Papert和Roger Schank等试图让机器像人一样思考，使之能够解决“理解故事”和“目标识别”一类问题。我们知道这些假设并不一定正确，使用这些事实的推理也未必符合逻辑，但是这一系列假设组成的结构正是我们所想和所说的一部分。他把这个结构称为“框架（frames）”。Schank使用了“框架”的一个变种，他称之为“脚本（scripts）”，基于这一想法他使程序能够回答关于一篇英语短文的提问。 多年之后的面向对象编程采纳了AI“框架”研究中的“继承（inheritance）”概念。 繁荣：1980 - 1987在80年代，一类名为“专家系统”的AI程序开始为全世界的公司所采纳，而“知识处理”成为了主流AI研究的焦点。日本政府在同一年代积极投资AI以促进其第五代计算机工程。80年代早期另一个令人振奋的事件是John Hopfield和David Rumelhart使联结主义重获新生。AI再一次获得了成功。 专家系统获得赏识专家系统是一种程序，能够依据一组从专门知识中推演出的逻辑规则在某一特定领域回答或解决问题。最早的示例由Edward Feigenbaum和他的学生们开发。1965年起设计的Dendral能够根据分光计读数分辨混合物。1972年设计的MYCIN能够诊断血液传染病。它们展示了这一方法的威力。专家系统仅限于一个很小的知识领域，从而避免了常识问题；其简单的设计又使它能够较为容易地编程实现或修改。总之，实践证明了这类程序的实用性。直到现在AI才开始变得实用起来。 知识革命专家系统的能力来自于它们存储的专业知识。这是70年代以来AI研究的一个新方向。 Pamela McCorduck在书中写道，“不情愿的AI研究者们开始怀疑，因为它违背了科学研究中对最简化的追求。智能可能需要建立在对分门别类的大量知识的多种处理方法之上。” “70年代的教训是智能行为与知识处理关系非常密切。有时还需要在特定任务领域非常细致的知识。” 知识库系统和知识工程成为了80年代AI研究的主要方向。 重获拨款：第五代工程1981年，日本经济产业省拨款八亿五千万美元支持第五代计算机项目。其目标是造出能够与人对话，翻译语言，解释图像，并且像人一样推理的机器。令“芜杂派”不满的是，他们选用Prolog作为该项目的主要编程语言。其他国家纷纷作出响应。英国开始了耗资三亿五千万英镑的Alvey工程。美国一个企业协会组织了MCC（Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation，微电子与计算机技术集团），向AI和信息技术的大规模项目提供资助。 DARPA也行动起来，组织了战略计算促进会（Strategic Computing Initiative），其1988年向AI的投资是1984年的三倍。 联结主义的重生1982年，物理学家John Hopfield证明一种新型的神经网络（现被称为“Hopfield网络”）能够用一种全新的方式学习和处理信息。大约在同时（早于Paul Werbos），David Rumelhart推广了反向传播算法，一种神经网络训练方法。这些发现使1970年以来一直遭人遗弃的联结主义重获新生。1986年由Rumelhart和心理学家James McClelland主编的两卷本论文集“分布式并行处理”问世，这一新领域从此得到了统一和促进。90年代神经网络获得了商业上的成功，它们被应用于光字符识别和语音识别软件。 第二次AI低谷：1987 - 199380年代中商业机构对AI的追捧与冷落符合经济泡沫的经典模式，泡沫的破裂也在政府机构和投资者对AI的观察之中。尽管遇到各种批评，这一领域仍在不断前进。来自机器人学这一相关研究领域的Rodney Brooks和Hans Moravec提出了一种全新的人工智能方案。 人工智能的低谷“AI之冬”一词由经历过1974年经费削减的研究者们创造出来。他们注意到了对专家系统的狂热追捧，预计不久后人们将转向失望。事实被他们不幸言中：从80年代末到90年代初，AI遭遇了一系列财政问题。变天的最早征兆是1987年AI硬件市场需求的突然下跌。Apple和IBM生产的台式机性能不断提升，到1987年时其性能已经超过了Symbolics和其他厂家生产的昂贵的Lisp机。老产品失去了存在的理由：一夜之间这个价值五亿美元的产业土崩瓦解。 躯体的重要性：Nouvelle AI与嵌入式推理80年代后期，一些研究者根据机器人学的成就提出了一种全新的人工智能方案。 他们相信，为了获得真正的智能，机器必须具有躯体 - 它需要感知，移动，生存，与这个世界交互。他们认为这些感知运动技能对于常识推理等高层次技能是至关重要的，而抽象推理不过是人类最不重要，也最无趣的技能（参见Moravec悖论）。他们号召“自底向上”地创造智能，这一主张复兴了从60年代就沉寂下来的控制论。在80年代和90年代也有许多认知科学家反对基于符号处理的智能模型，认为身体是推理的必要条件，这一理论被称为“具身的心灵/理性/ 认知（embodied mind/reason/cognition）”论题。 AI：1993 - 现在现已年过半百的AI终于实现了它最初的一些目标。它已被成功地用在技术产业中，不过有时是在幕后。这些成就有的归功于计算机性能的提升，有的则是在高尚的科学责任感驱使下对特定的课题不断追求而获得的。不过，至少在商业领域里AI的声誉已经不如往昔了。“实现人类水平的智能”这一最初的梦想曾在60年代令全世界的想象力为之着迷，其失败的原因至今仍众说纷纭。各种因素的合力将AI拆分为各自为战的几个子领域，有时候它们甚至会用新名词来掩饰“人工智能”这块被玷污的金字招牌。AI比以往的任何时候都更加谨慎，却也更加成功。 里程碑和摩尔定律1997年5月11日，深蓝成为战胜国际象棋世界冠军卡斯帕罗夫的第一个计算机系统。2005年，Stanford开发的一台机器人在一条沙漠小径上成功地自动行驶了131英里，赢得了DARPA挑战大赛头奖。2009年，蓝脑计划声称已经成功地模拟了部分鼠脑。2011年，IBM 沃森参加《危险边缘》节目，在最后一集打败了人类选手。2016年3月，AlphaGo击败李世乭，成为第一个不让子而击败职业围棋棋士的电脑围棋程式。2017年5月，AlphaGo在中国乌镇围棋峰会的三局比赛中击败当时世界排名第一的中国棋手柯洁。这些成就的取得并不是因为范式上的革命。它们仍然是工程技术的复杂应用，但是计算机性能已经今非昔比了。事实上，深蓝计算机比克里斯多福·斯特雷奇（Christopher Strachey）在1951年用来下棋的Ferranti Mark 1快一千万倍。这种剧烈增长可以用摩尔定律描述：计算速度和内存容量每两年翻一番。计算性能上的基础性障碍已被逐渐克服。 智能代理90年代，被称为“智能代理”的新范式被广泛接受。尽管早期研究者提出了模块化的分治策略， 但是直到Judea Pearl，Alan Newell等人将一些概念从决策理论和经济学中引入AI之后现代智能代理范式才逐渐形成。当经济学中的“理性代理（rational agent）”与计算机科学中的“对象”或“模块”相结合，“智能代理”范式就完善了。智能代理是一个系统，它感知周围环境，然后采取措施使成功的几率最大化。最简单的智能代理是解决特定问题的程序。已知的最复杂的智能代理是理性的，会思考的人类。智能代理范式将AI研究定义为“对智能代理的学习”。这是对早期一些定义的推广：它超越了研究人类智能的范畴，涵盖了对所有种类的智能的研究。这一范式让研究者们通过学习孤立的问题找到可证的并且有用的解答。它为AI各领域乃至经济学，控制论等使用抽象代理概念的领域提供了描述问题和共享解答的一种通用语言。人们希望能找到一种完整的代理架构（像Newell的en:SOAR那样），允许研究者们应用交互的智能代理建立起通用的智能系统。 “简约派”的胜利越来越多的AI研究者们开始开发和使用复杂的数学工具。人们广泛地认识到，许多AI需要解决的问题已经成为数学，经济学和运筹学领域的研究课题。数学语言的共享不仅使AI可以与其他学科展开更高层次的合作，而且使研究结果更易于评估和证明。AI已成为一门更严格的科学分支。 Russell和Norvig（2003）将这些变化视为一场“革命”和“简约派的胜利”。Judea Pearl发表于1988年的名著将概率论和决策理论引入AI。现已投入应用的新工具包括贝叶斯网络，隐马尔可夫模型，信息论，随机模型和经典优化理论。针对神经网络和进化算法等“计算智能”范式的精确数学描述也被发展出来。 幕后的AIAI研究者们开发的算法开始变为较大的系统的一部分。AI曾经解决了大量的难题，这些解决方案在产业界起到了重要作用。应用了AI技术的有数据挖掘，工业机器人，物流，语音识别，银行业软件，医疗诊断和Google搜索引擎等。AI领域并未从这些成就之中获得多少益处。AI的许多伟大创新仅被看作计算机科学工具箱中的一件工具。Nick Bostrom解释说，“很多AI的前沿成就已被应用在一般的程序中，不过通常没有被称为AI。这是因为，一旦变得足够有用和普遍，它就不再被称为AI了。”90年代的许多AI研究者故意用其他一些名字称呼他们的工作，例如信息学，知识系统，认知系统或计算智能。部分原因是他们认为他们的领域与AI存在根本的不同，不过新名字也有利于获取经费。至少在商业领域，导致AI之冬的那些未能兑现的承诺仍然困扰着AI研究，正如New York Times在2005年的一篇报道所说：“计算机科学家和软件工程师们避免使用人工智能一词，因为怕被认为是在说梦话。” HAL 9000在哪里?1968年亚瑟·克拉克和史丹利·库柏力克创作的《“2001太空漫游”》中设想2001年将会出现达到或超过人类智能的机器。他们创造的这一名为HAL-9000的角色是以科学事实为依据的：当时许多顶极AI研究者相信到2001年这样的机器会出现。“那么问题是，为什么在2001年我们并未拥有HAL呢?” 马文·闵斯基问道。 Minsky认为，问题的答案是绝大多数研究者醉心于钻研神经网络和遗传算法之类商业应用，而忽略了常识推理等核心问题。另一方面，约翰·麦卡锡则归咎于资格问题（en:qualification problem）。雷蒙德·库茨魏尔相信问题在于计算机性能，根据摩尔定律，他预测具有人类智能水平的机器将在2029年出现。杰夫·霍金认为神经网络研究忽略了人类大脑皮质的关键特性，而简单的模型只能用于解决简单的问题。还有许多别的解释，每一个都对应着一个正在进行的研究计划。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[我认为先发影响力所谓的「Pre-suasion」也是一种助推（Nudge）。为了说服受众，不在B（预期行为）阶段动手，而在A（前置条件）阶段动手。不是直接去说服受众采取B，而是通过改变A来促成B。 导言：引爆影响力：让注意力提前就绪P3 最优秀的说服者之所以优秀，在于擅长先发制人：对说服过程加以设计，让接受信息的人在与信息相遇之前就准备好接受。 P3 我们最先展示的东西，改变了受众对接下来展示的东西的体验。 P5 Pre-suasion能提高后期说服的概率，但不能百分百保证说服。 P8 Pre-suasion有很多手法和形式，行为学家给他们贴了很多不同的标签，比如「框架」「锚定」「启动」「心态」「第一印象」等，本书统称为「开关」（opener）。开关的两个作用： 第一部分 注意力：先发影响力第一大武器一、特权瞬间：制造转瞬即逝的顺从Pre-suasion改变受众的关注点，影响他们的判断和决策。 P297 在很大程度上，面对选择时，我们是什么样的人，取决于我们在做出选择之前的那个瞬间把注意力放在了什么地方。 P13 Pre-suasion往往能在他人身上制造出转瞬即逝的顺从，即「特权瞬间」（privileged moments），这是「开关」制造的机会窗口，这时候，提议方的力量最大。 人们有证真倾向，所以提问方式会影响（关注点和）结果。 二、焦点最重要：注意力的重要性之一P41 凡是把注意力往自己身上引的事情，都能让旁观者高估其重要性。 P42 卡尼曼认为「聚焦错觉」（focusing illusion）很重要：生活中没有什么事是非同小可的，除非你正在想它。 P42 媒体虽然不能决定人们怎么想（How），但是可以通过「议程设置」（agenda setting）来影响人们想什么（What）。大面积的报道让观众对特定主题投入了更多的关注，误以为这些事情更加重要。 三、焦点即原因：注意力的重要性之二由于最高位者最显眼，所以他往往被赋予过度的因果角色。实际上成败是领导者和团队共同的责任，但是胜负都会归因于领导者，因为他是焦点所在。 P79 有人指出，在体育比赛里，裁判毁为队服颜色更扎眼的运动员分配更多的因果关系（Hagemann，Strauss &amp; Leissing，2008；Rowe，Harris &amp; Roberts，2005） 四、注意力开关：如何吸引注意力P84 性和暴力等元素最能吸引注意力。 P87 分手的最佳预测指标是当事人是否经常意识到身边出现了帅哥美女，是否对其给予关注。 P91研究团队成员弗拉德·格里什科维舍斯（Vlad Griskevicius）启发作者采用演化视角去看待性和暴力：「碰到危险情况时，人们进化出了加入群体、避免落单的强烈倾向，因为人多更安全、势力更大，碰到天敌或敌人时，一个人的风险很大。然而，碰到存在性交可能性的情况时，事情就反过来了。人会想避开集体，以求成为浪漫关系的主要获益方。」 P92 可以通过先发内容，激发特定「开关」，让人进入性偏好或者安全偏好状态，然后促成说服目的。 P94 一个多世纪后，身体反应不再被称为「反射」，而是叫做「定向反应」（orienting response）。 五、注意力磁铁：如何保持注意力P102 有关自己的信息是一枚极为强大的注意力磁铁。 P103 很多文本使用「你」来指代受众，预先让他们进入状态。 P105 开会的时候，如果胸有成竹，希望杯关注，那就坐在领导对面，好好表现。如果心里没底，就坐在领导边上，准备好被忽视。（因为你在发言的时候，领导刚好在准备自己的发言，没时间听你的，或者他刚讲完，正在回味，没时间听你的）圈套15：未完成 P107 存在「蔡卡尼克效应」，即未完成的任务记得更清楚。 第二部分 联想：先发影响力第二大武器六、语言联想：文字和图像P125 作者总结著名心理语言学家居恩·谢明（Gun Semin）的结论：运用语言的主要目的是将听众的注意力引导到现实的某一点上。一旦完成，听众对这一关注点的联想就将占据上风，从而左右人的反应。 P133 短暂接触温暖的东西，如热咖啡，就会让人的态度变得温和，相对于拿着冰冷咖啡的人而言。 P141 让被试执行一项需要审慎评估问题解决方法的任务时，看到罗丹的雕塑作品《思考者》的照片的人，其决策正确率提高了48%（Chen &amp; Latham，2014） P294-295 为了促成医生洗手，人们在医院里设置提醒招牌，发现「手部卫生能保护你免于感染疾病」不如「手部卫生能保护患者免于感染疾病」的效果好，后者效果好45%。 七、情境联想：外部环境与内在体验P147 在家里写通俗作品，在学校里写学术论文。 P151 「医学生综合症」：研究表明，70%～80%的医学生在学习疾病的时候，不管是什么病，总会体验到相关的症状，并确信自己染了病。虽然预见过这一现象的教授早就警告过大家，可似乎完全没用。 P153 老年人会更加关注事物的积极面，因而更加阳光。 八、关于先发影响力的重要提醒1：使用范围、实施方法和失效方法P168 先发影响力成功的关键：让受众从一开始就把关注点放在与尚未达到的信息有关且一致的概念上。 P172 想要借助先发影响力促使人才去行动，就应该找一个跟该行动有着强烈正相关的概念，在请求协助之前，把这个概念带入信息接受方的脑袋里。实验发现，关联度越高，则效果越好。 P174 关联是可以建构出来的。 P175 把一种品牌的漱口水跟美丽的自然风光叠加显示6次，会让观众立刻对该品牌产生更多好感，且这种好感能持续到3个星期以后。 让先发影响力失效的三种方法： 简单的提醒P178-179 问人们心情好不好，阴天就会差一点，晴天就会好一点。但是如果提醒下「顺带问下，您那里天气如何」，这种晴雨天效应就会立刻消失。 过于明显的意图P181 硬植入的广告效果不如软植入，那些明显的广告不如含蓄的广告。（27%比47%）因为消费者在发现意图后会自行对偏差进行「矫正」。 深入的思考P182 广告在深夜效果更好，因为这时候人们的意志力已经所剩无几。 第三部分 联盟：影响力的第七大武器九、影响力武器放大器：如何更有效地应用影响力六大原则第一阶段：培养积极关系——互惠、喜好原则1：互惠P197 互惠的关键在于：抓住机会，抢先赠予。礼物效果加成的三个点：（对当事人）有意义、出乎意料、（为当事人）量身定制。其中，量身定制效果最好。 P218 避风港行动：二战期间得到基督徒帮助的犹太人，在2015年帮助叙利亚和伊拉克的基督徒家庭逃离ISIS的威胁。 原则2：喜好我们喜欢和自己相似的人，还有赞扬我们的人。销售人员抢先表达自己对客户的喜爱。 第二阶段：减少不确定性——社会认同、权威原则3：社会认同社会认同让人觉得自己的行为是恰当的，表现在有效性和可行性上。P206-207 为了借助社会认同引擎来促使企业停止污染，很多国家先是在行业内部对排污企业的环境绩效进行评估，接着公布评分，让该行业的所有企业都能看到自己跟同行比较起来做得如何。据说这么做能带来30%的改善。 原则4：权威权威的效果建立在专业知识和可信赖感基础上的。P220 不动产公司的接线员在说话时，仅仅把「中介」改称「专业中介」，就能提高16%的成交概率。P209 欲扬先抑的做法，可以增强可信赖感。具体做法，就是在陈述之初，即提到自己的观点的缺陷。这样做可以产生信赖感，有利于让听众接受后面的内容。P211 如果优点不光能在利弊权衡中增加积极面，还能暗示弱点无关紧要，那么，先抑后扬的手法就能发挥出最佳的效果。 第三阶段：激励行动——稀缺、一致原则5：稀缺稀缺不光提高了损失的可能性，还提升了物品的估值。 原则6：承诺和一致十、身心合一：影响力第七大武器之一P227 联盟感（「我们」感）基于两类因素：以特定的方式在一起，以特定的方式共同行动。P228-229 亲人牌效果好：作者让班里163个学生把问卷寄给家长，若能返回，则未来考试时能加一分，结果159人寄回了问卷（97%）。P230-232 巴菲特在致股东的信里大打亲情牌。 十一、行动合一：影响力第七大武器之二共同行动带来相互认同P251 有充分证据表明，跟他人，哪怕是陌生人一起行动，能产生联盟感，提升喜好之情。P251 让白人被试看了黑人被试表演喝水之后，用同一杯子喝水，可以大大提高其认同感，消除种族歧视。P252 曾经一起齐步走过的小伙伴，之后合作的概率更高。协同反应带来联盟感，让人愿意放弃一些个人利益来换回集体利益。 促成行为合一的有效方法： 1、音乐共鸣P252-255 音乐在无意识层面发挥作用，激发情感，超越认知，带来相似身心反应，塑造联盟感。P253 德国的一项针对4岁儿童的研究发现，有音乐伴奏的搭档绕圈走，比没有音乐的搭档绕圈走，事后相互帮助的概率，高出3倍。P255 音乐和情感的高度相关性，为歌手带来了福利，年轻姑娘特别容易对歌手动情，此事完全不讲逻辑。 2、持续交换P257 男女在一起，只需花上45分钟不断相互自我披露，即可建立很强的情感纽带关系。曼迪·莱恩·卡特伦（Mandy Len Catron）以此为发现，写了一本《想爱上一个人，请这么做》。曼迪总共有36个自我披露的问题。 3、共同创作存在宜家效应，人们喜欢自己参与过的事务。共同创作也让人们产生相互认同。 4、征求意见企业向消费者征求关于商品的具体建议（而非意见）。P262 提建议会让消费者觉得自己和企业是联盟。 十二、关于先发影响力的重要提醒2：道德伦理P271 作者认为，30年前的《影响力》中没有提出任何可供专业人士采用的新技术，相反，让消费者了解了销售人员是如何说服他们的。但是《先发影响力》里的很多技术，业内人士也还开始广泛使用，所以存在道德风险。 尾声：影响力长尾：持久的影响力P288 我们如何避免好感蒸发？如何让影响力长期持久？策略有二： 1、主动自愿的承诺P298 与自己相关时，公开、主动、自愿付出的承诺更有效。与自己无关的时候，私下的承诺更有效。（Kristofferson et al., 2014） 2、设置自动反应线索引入「执行意图」概念，让受众能经常性地接触到线索，激活起自动反应。P186 执行意图的研究主要来自彼得·格尔维策及其夫人和同事们。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[六种影响力武器为：互惠、承诺和一致、社会认同、喜好、权威、稀缺。其实都是利用了人性中几个最基本的弱点，包括：贪婪、无知、爱面子、懒惰又爱走捷径。虽然听起来都是非常糟糕的特质，但事实上，这只是人类在长久的进化中，保留的几种大多数时候可以保障自己活下去的特质。总的来说，在于两方面。一是融入社会，二是在社会中作个体活下去。 第1章 影响力的武器动物可能会因为看到某种颜色的羽毛而变得具有攻击性，或是听到某种叫声就对自己的天敌呵护有加。动物这种愚蠢可笑的机械反应在人类身上也有，当某一个触发特征出现时，我们会不假思索地作出相应的反应。之所以会这样，就是因为我们被难以察觉的影响力武器摆布了。 为什么无人问津的东西，价格乘以2以后，反而被一抢而空？ 为什么房地产商在售楼时，会先带顾客去看没人会买的破房子？ 为什么汽车经销商在顾客掏钱买车之后才会建议顾客购买各种配件？第2章 互惠互惠原理认为，我们应该尽量以类似的方式报答他人为我们所做的一切。简单地说，就是对他人的某种行为，我们要以一种类似的行为去加以回报。如果人家施恩于你，你就应该以恩情报之，而不能对此不理不睬，更不能以怨报德。于是，我们身边这一最有效的影响力武器，就被某些人利用谋取利益了。 为什么精明的政客会让连普通人都能看出来的愚蠢的“水门事件”发生？ 为什么我们明明不喜欢某个人，却对他提出的要求无法拒绝？ 为什么超市总喜欢提供“免费试用”？第3章 承诺和一致承诺和一致原理认为，一旦作出了一个选择或采取了某种立场，我们就会立刻碰到来自内心和外部的压力迫使我们的言行与它保持一致。在这样的压力之下，我们想法设法地以行动证明自己先前的决定是正确的。 为什么像宝洁和通用食品这样的大公司，经常发起有奖征文比赛，参赛者无需购买该公司任何产品，却有机会获得大奖？ 为什么一些二手车经销商在收购旧车时，会故意高估旧车的价格？总结来说：公开&gt;私下，书面&gt;口头，自由&gt;强迫。第4章 社会认同社会认同原理认为，在判断何为正确时，我们会根据别人的意见行事。尤其是当我们正赛特定情形下判断某一行为是否正确时。如果我们看到别人在某种场合做某件事，我们就会断定这样做是有道理的。 在遇到紧急情况时，什么才是最有效的求救方式？ 为什么当自杀事件广为报道时，报道所覆盖的地区自杀事件反而增多了？ 为什么圭亚那琼斯城的910名教徒会集体自杀？第5章 喜好我们大多数人总是更容易答应自己认识和喜爱的人所提出的要求，对于这一点，恐怕不会有人感到吃惊。令人吃惊的是，有些我们完全不认识的人却想出了上百种方法利用这条简单的原理，让我们顺从他们的要求。 为什么特百惠公司的家庭聚会能使每天的销售额超过250万美元？ 为什么在审讯嫌疑犯的过程中“好警察”、“坏警察”搭档的方法巧妙地运用了喜好原理？ 为什么狂怒的球迷会在比赛输掉以后杀死运动员和裁判员？我们偏向于喜欢有一下几类特点的人： 有外表魅力。 与我们有相似性。 恭维我们的人。 在目的一致的情况下，同我们进行接触和合作的人。第6章 权威权威所具有的强大力量会影响我们的行为，即使是具有独立思考能力的成年人也会为了服从权威的命令而作出一些完全丧失理智的事情来。 为什么受过正规培训的护理人员会毫不犹豫地执行一个来自医生的明明漏洞百出的指示？ 为什么行骗高手们总是以换装作为一种行骗手段？第7章 稀缺“机会越少见，价值似乎就越高”的稀缺原理会对我们行为的方方面面造成影响，对失去某种东西的恐惧似乎要比对获得同一物品的渴望，更能激发人们的行动力。 为什么面值一元的错版纸币，其价值远远超过了面值的几百倍？ 为什么在拍卖场里，人们会不由自主地不停举牌？ 青少年反叛的根源在哪里？尾声 即时的影响力在正常情况下,促使我们作出顺从决策的几个最常用的信息，都可以引导我们作出正确的决策，这就是为什么我们在决策时频繁、机械地使用互惠、言行一致、社会认同、喜好、权威以及稀缺原理的原因。每个原理本身都能够极为可靠地提示我们，什么时候说“是”比说“不”更加有利。但现实中，大量的、极易伪造的信息被人利用，他们借此引诱我们作出机械的反应并从中获利，我们不得不防。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[大问题：简明哲学导论]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-12-12-Book-BigQuestion%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[本书非常好地解决了哲学与生活现景的联系问题，而不是论证唯物辨证的绝对权威性。我们要的哲学，不是做学问，是认识如何活着以及活着的意义，然而也并非心灵鸡汤。开篇第一句话便是苏格拉底那句著名的话：“未经审视的生活是不值得过的”。这话之引起我们悚然重视，正与我们转身即忘一样容易。 哲学主要不是研究其他人的观点，而是努力用尽可能有说服力、尽可能使人感兴趣的语言清楚地表述你的观点，这才是做哲学，而不仅仅是读一下别人是怎么说的……本书正是要帮助你做到这一点，那就是把以往的哲学家及其伟大的思想作为启发，作为一种组织你自己观点的方式去做哲学，去表达你的想法，唤起你单凭自己的能力可能无法想到的他种可能性。你应当独立思考，澄清你所倾向的是哪种观点，以及为什么是那种观点，并把这些观点组织起来以应对其他的可能看法。 大体上，本书的逻辑框架是这样的： 开宗明义，先作“生活有何意义”的发问。首先什么是“意义”？ 第二个问题是“上帝”，探讨信仰。“实在”与“真理”，亦本体论与认识论。 “自我”是什么？是否存在“自我”这个东西？其实自我就是对自己的一种解释，最后它变成了一种生活方式，这种生活方式里，你就成了自己计划和行动中的那个“某个人”。 追问完个人问题后，我们将面对个人与社会的关系：自由，道德，正义。 自由，有个体关于自由的认知（绝对自由？），从整个社会存在来观察的自由（相对自由？）。而作为个人价值观的“自由”，往往倒是破坏性的，与其他社会价值观之间存在矛盾。 道德，道德是指导我们行动的原则和规则，形成一个社会的基本结构。接受道德的目的是为了美好的生活，因此道德可看作是一种生活目标。康德老师说，道德与原则合理性相关，与行动后果无关。道德原则合理性的检验标准是其可普遍性，也即是能够普遍适用于任何人和任何地方，说到底是一种权威。 好的生活除了自由、道德，还必须有正义。正义与自由、道德往往联结紧密不可分离。霍布豪斯在《自由主义》中讲第一个要素公民自由，就强调自由意味着平等与公正。本书作者讲正义的出发点是从政府的必要性与合法性开始，认为政府是必要的，但必须是严格选举及合法的。我的理解是先要先弄清楚政府代表谁？政府与个人应划定的边界在哪里？怎样来划定？然后社会的正义包括：1）报应的正义（即涉及到惩罚）；2）分配的正义（关于分配的正义自由主义对此有诸多争议）。而平等则是关于正义的核心问题，基本内容至少应包含法律面前的平等、平等尊重的观念（人性主义）。然后谈到社会契约论。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[幸福的婚姻]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-12-07-Book-7ForMakingMarriageWork%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[传统实验方法：自我报告法。让夫妻二人针对婚姻满意度填写调查表创新实验方法： 序列研究。评估不同婚龄的夫妇，对研究对象进行动态追踪 观察法（实验室状态下）。 访问法。采访双方的婚姻史、婚姻观以及对父母婚姻的看法；让他们谈论这一天是怎么过的，谈论婚姻中的分歧，或者一些令人高兴的话题，用磁带录下来并用仪器测量他们各项生理指标 在大量的观察中，戈特曼总结出了一对夫妻离婚的迹象： 以习惯性的苛刻方式开始谈话 争论期间出现批评、鄙视、辩护、冷战中的某些或全部 （一方或双方）被消极情绪淹没 失败的感情修复尝试（感情修复尝试：通过一些语言或行动，不管是愚蠢的还是聪明的，来防止消极情绪升级） 改写曾经的美好回忆。当一桩婚姻进展不顺时，历史就会往坏的方面改写，或者是你发现自己很难记得过去的事，过去变得无足轻重或让你痛苦，你索性遗忘了它。一段婚姻如果走到了这个地步，那么它几乎注定要破裂。 约翰·戈特曼开篇就驳斥了以冲突消解法为核心的传统婚姻疗法，这种基于积极倾听的疗法是从卡尔·罗杰斯的个人心理疗法中使用的改编而来。当病人对治疗师倾吐时，治疗师会点点头，并回应道“我听见你说…而你觉得这样…”治疗师父的目的是创造一个他与病人有同感的的环境，以便在病人感到安全的情形下探索他的内在思想和感情。这种疗法的成功率很低，只有35%，一年后更是降到了18%左右。这不仅是因为积极倾听这种方法在两个人发怒或心情不佳时很难做到，更是因为成功解决冲突并不能使婚姻幸福。戈特曼的方法建议在通晓是什么因素使得婚姻成功的基础上，而不是建立在是什么因素导致婚姻失败的基础上（和近几十年来心理学的转向类似）。由此总结出了幸福婚姻的七# 法则 法则一：绘制爱情地图（了解对方，而不是试图改变对方）爱情地图：指你的大脑中存放所有关于配偶生活信息的地方，这是夫妻为婚姻所制造的大量认知空间。从彼此了解中不仅能产生爱情，还能产生平安渡过婚姻风暴的力量。特别是当生活发生突如其来的转变时，拥有详细的爱情地图就显得至关重要。新生儿的来临常使妻子迅速进入“母亲”的角色，随之而来的是许多生活习性上的变化。而丈夫常常会跟不上妻子转变的步伐，他也许不能理解或者不高兴见到这种转变。任何大的改变，从工作变动到生病退休，都有同样的效果，甚至单单是时间的流逝都能起到这个效果。所以需要相互了解的地方总是很多。生活改变了我们，5年后、10年后或者15年后，现在的你和当年在婚礼上宣誓的你可能不是同一个人。维持一段幸福婚姻的关键，就是定期询问：“最近怎么样？”练习：爱情地图游戏；自我探索并与配偶分享 法则二：维持喜爱与赞美喜爱与赞美系统：夫妻双方各自都保留了一些最基本的感觉，觉得对方值得尊重、敬佩甚至喜爱。对维持一桩有价值的、长久的感情生活而言，喜爱和赞美是两个非常重要的因素，如果一对夫妻的这套系统仍然在起作用，他们的婚姻就可以挽救。而检验一对夫妻的喜爱与赞美系统是否仍在起作用，最好的方法通常是观察他们如何看待他们的过去，是觉得美好还是不堪。对过去的幸福回忆不仅能能成为“鄙视”的解毒剂，更能在坏事来临时起到缓冲作用。重建该系统的方法有：写下对方3个积极的特点，以及生活中的对应事件；谈论两人过去经历的幸福事件；每天做一份正面陈述或想法。第三种练习书上给出了详细的计划表，它是以对复述正面想法的功效的广泛研究为基础的，也是认知疗法的信条之一。像任何练习一样，如果你常常做，你的语言（更重要的是你的想法）将变成你的第二天性。 法则三：彼此靠近而非远离（定期做出沟通尝试，并回应对方）沟通尝试：任何希望同对方进行情感沟通的行为都可称为沟通尝试，可能是一个问题、一个手势或是轻轻的身体接触。每一次成功的沟通尝试都像是往“感情银行”里增加了一笔储蓄。增加感情储蓄的活动有很多种，而其中最有效的一种是“下班后和家人聚在一起谈谈这一天是怎样过的”。选一个双方闲暇的事件，做好准备，花上20~30分钟交谈，基本原则是“谈论任何你想分享的事情，除了你们的婚姻”。这个练习需要积极倾听。积极倾听是婚姻问题治疗中的经典技巧，也是首选技巧，它的目的是让你在不作评判的情况下换位思考，去聆听配偶的观点。而要达到这个目的，你们的婚姻就不能是谈论的内容，你的配偶也不能是讨论针对的对象。 积极倾听的要点： 轮流说 表达你的理解：让配偶知道你同情对方，“是的，真是太……了”；“我也觉得太……了”；“我完全明白你为什么这么……” 理解先于建议：提供解决方法之前，必须让对方知道你完全理解并同情对方遇到的困境 表示真的感兴趣：不要心不在焉，要提问题，要有眼神交流，要适时点头，要说“嗯”、“啊”“然后呢”之类的话表示自己正在倾听 站在配偶那边 表达“一致对外”的态度：让对方知道你们是在共同面对这个问题，休戚与共。 有时候你感受到另一方的冷落，并认为疏远和孤单的出现全是配偶的错。有这样的想法很正常，但事实上可能谁都没有错。而为了打破这个模式，你们必须承认你们两个人都制造了问题。 法则四：让配偶影响你（尤其是对男性来说） 绝大部分妻子允许丈夫影响她的决策，而丈夫则倾向于不让妻子影响自己和分享权利。许多丈夫宁愿用四骑士盖过妻子的话、摧毁她的观点吗，也不愿意注重她的感受、接受她的建议。而当男人不愿意同他的配偶分享权力时，婚姻破裂的可能性则高达81%。 “夫妻权力分享”是一个比较新的概念，它是在过去几十年间发生的巨大社会变动后出现，因此丈夫角色的改变对许多男人来说是一项挑战。宾夕法尼亚大学的Peggy Sanday教授是人类学家，她专门研究并比较全世界的采猎文化，结果发现某些决定一种文化到底是男权还是男女平等的要素。根据她的研究，男权社会的特征如下： 食物匮乏，生活艰辛，周围的环境周潜藏着种种危险 大型动物的肉差不多总是比其他食物更珍贵，猎杀大型动物差不多全部是男人干的活 男人不用照顾和抚养婴儿，他们也许会照料孩子，但不是婴儿。 在这种文化的神圣象征中，女性的图像非常有限，尤其是在它的创世文化中。而在我们的文化中，这些要素都不可避免地在往反方向发展，因此丈夫们在这点上一定要学会让步。 法则五：解决可解决的问题（以温和开场，以妥协收场）婚姻中69%的冲突是永远存在的，它们无法被解决，比如何时生育孩子、教养孩子的方式以及性生活的频率等，无论是幸福的婚姻还是破裂的婚姻都一样。区别在于，对婚姻感到满意的情侣们学会了把问题悬而不决，不让它们影响两人的关系。婚姻的成功取决于你选择了多少你能对付的问题。 解决可解决冲突的步骤： 以温和的方式开始（看上去简单，但其实非常困难，而且是至关重要的一步） 学会提出和接受感情修复尝试 自我安抚和相互安抚 学会妥协 容忍对方的缺点 第一步：讨论以什么样的方式开始，通常就会以什么样的方式结束。温和的开始有利于避免末日四骑士的出现，减少情感淹没的发生。妻子需要特别注意这点，因为她们更可能是问题的提出者，男人相对来说更容易出现情绪淹没感，他们的身体对情感压力的反应更敏感，因此更倾向于避免对抗。要做到这一步，可以尝试以下的建议： 可以抱怨，不要责备。说“后院里到处都是狗粪，我真是被它烦透了，我们说好了由你来清理不是吗？”，而不是“后院里到处都是狗粪，这全是你的错，你完全没有责任心。” 只描述事实，不做评价或判断。不要谴责或责备配偶，只要描述你看到的事实就行。不要说“你从来不照顾孩子”，而要说“我今天似乎是唯一一个围着孩子转的人”。 明确地表达观点。不要期望配偶能看透你的心思，不要说“你把餐厅弄得一塌糊涂”，而要说“如果你能把你留在餐桌上的东西清理干净，我会很感激”。不要说“你能不能照顾一次孩子”，而要说“请你给艾米换个尿不湿，再给他一瓶牛奶”。 学会以赞赏的口气来表达你的请求。请求配偶做他过去做得很好、现在你怀念的那些事情，比如“还记得我们过去每个星期六晚上一起度过的时间吗，我喜欢和单独相处，这样的感觉让人安心，为什么我们不重新开始这样做呢？” 第二步：感情修复尝试就是当你发现争论一开始就出了错，或者自己处在无休止的指责循环中时，懂得如何刹车以阻止进一步灾难发生的那些行为。而在不幸的婚姻中，即使是明显的感情修复尝试可能对方也难以领会。因此采用规范化的脚本语言（描述自己的感受；道歉；要求暂停；赞赏对方），或是明确告诉对方自己打算提出一个感情修复尝试都是可接受的选择。第三步：被消极情绪淹没时，无论多么周到的感情修复尝试都是无效的。此时唯一合理的策略是让配偶知道你被消极情绪淹没，需要休息一会儿。而最好的安抚方法是沉思，也可以是类似的放松练习。第四步：无论你喜欢还是不喜欢，解决婚姻问题的唯一方法是寻求妥协。记住，任何妥协的基础是刚刚我们提到的# 法则四——接受配偶的影响。你们可以共同选定一个可解决的问题，各自在纸上画一个同心圆，在较小的圆圈里列出无法让步之处，在大圆圈里列出可以妥协的方面。写的时候努力使大圆圈的内容尽可能地多，小圆圈的内容尽可能少，才有希望达成妥协。第五步：容忍对方的缺点。婚姻常常陷入“要是”困境，要是配偶再高一点、再富裕一点、再聪明一点、再整洁一点或再性感一点，你们所有的问题都会烟消云散。一旦这种心态占了上风，冲突就很难解决。在你接受配偶的缺点和不足之前，你不可能成功地向对方妥协，相反，你会一直想方设法改变你的配偶。冲突的解决不在于改变一个人，而在于协商，寻找共同点，找到双方都能适应的方法。 可解决的问题： 工作压力 姻亲关系 为人父母 家务活 金钱 性 工作压力：在每天的日程表中安排一个放松时间，互相谈论彼此这一天发生的事。（参考# 法则三）姻亲关系：家庭关系的紧张常发生在妻子和婆婆之间，这两个女人在观点、个性和生活观念上的分歧是不可改变的。婆媳关系紧张的核心，是两个女人为了得到一个男人的爱而发动的地盘争夺战，而唯一摆脱困境的方法只能是丈夫和妻子一起反对他的母亲。一开始，母亲的感情或许会受到伤害，但她最终会适应这个现实。当然，这不是说当父母被贬低或羞辱时你还应该不分对错地支持妻子。 为人父母：在第一个宝宝出世后，70%的妻子对婚姻的满意度急剧下降，而丈夫的不满意感通常出现在妻子之后，因为他的不满意是对妻子情绪的一种反应。能否平安度过这一阶段的关键在于：丈夫和妻子是一起经历父母身份的转换还是他跟不上妻子变化的节奏。当然，这不是说男性在这场冲突中要负主要责任，而是对他们来说这个角色转换的过程需要更多主动的努力。下面是一些可供采取的措施 关注你们的夫妻友谊。参见# 法则一 不要把爸爸从照顾孩子的任务中排挤出去。初为人母的妻子很容易包揽下所有照顾孩子的任务，或是忍不住指挥、命令丈夫用她认为合适的方法对待孩子。结果就是，丈夫做得越来越少，不可避免地觉得自己被妻子（和孩子）排除在外。解决方法非常简单：妻子需要让步。为了让父亲继续献身家庭，一个婴儿和一桩婚姻需要付出小小的代价。 让爸爸成为宝宝的玩伴。男人可能要花很久的时间才能和他们的孩子“连接”在一起，这其中的缘由是（已经被无数的研究证实过）：女人更倾向于抚养孩子，而男人则更倾向于和孩子玩耍。但其实新生儿也非常有趣，只要花时间了解，父亲就会发现孩子喜欢和他玩，他在孩子的生活中扮演着重要的角色。 注意爸爸的需要。即使理智上明白孩子的需求比他的需求更重要，但丈夫也会怀念妻子从前的模样。妻子越是认识到丈夫所放弃的是什么，越是让丈夫知道他仍然是她生活中最重要的，丈夫就越能理解她、支持她。 让妈妈休息一下。 家务活：男人常常没有认识到女人是多么深切地关心房子的整洁有序，所以解决这个冲突的唯一办法就是：男人必须做更多的家务！如果一个男人主动做家务的话，女人会觉得他更性感；如果他能根据妻子的需求灵活变更自己的工作任务，借此表示对妻子的尊重，用这种方式帮助妻子，这可能比看任何成人录像更能让她兴奋。金钱：金钱是一个永久性的问题，因为金钱象征着许多情感需求，如安全感和权力，它还是我们个人的核心价值体系。无论银行存款是有余还是不足，许多夫妻都会遇到重大的金钱冲突。夫妻双方都需要有财政预算，列出自己最近的开销，管理每天的开支，为将来的经济做打算。共同检查开支的过程会让你们再次觉得两人是一个团队，而不该为这些问题而争论。性：这个话题比较尴尬，使得夫妻双方经常“模糊”地谈论这个问题。当你和配偶谈论性话题的时候，你的态度应该一直是这样：你正在让一个好东西变得更好。即使你不满意目前的性生活，也要突出好的一面。性行为的可塑性很强，因此，让性爱符合彼此的要求是有可能的。做爱的次数越多，做爱的质量也会越好，花时间了解并记住对方的喜好是必要的，也是有效的一种方法。 法则六：学会和问题一起生活当你们在某个长期问题上陷入僵局时，先试着走出僵局。化解僵局的目的不是让你去解决这个问题，是让你摆脱僵局，展开对话。为了帮助你走出僵局，你首先要了解造成僵局的原因。不管这是个重大问题（比如要把自己的宗教信仰传递给孩子），还是—个可笑的小问题（如叠餐巾的方法），僵局都是一种迹象，它表明你有你的人生梦想，而配偶不重视或者不尊重这些梦想。我说的梦想是指希望、志向和愿望，它们都是你身份的一部分，给你树立目标，让你的生活充满意义。我们最深远的梦想常常源于童年时代，你也许渴望重建小时候家庭生活中最温暖的回忆，或是觉得需要远离一些会引发痛苦回忆的事件。因此，即便是如星期天在家吃饭还是去餐馆吃饭这样的事，实际上都可能是一种象征，象征着那个使我们感觉被爱的东西。因此，当你陷入僵局，首先要做的是判断你是否正在与一个隐藏的梦想做搏斗，判断标准是：你把配偶看作是导致这个问题的唯一源泉。例如，如果你发现自己认为某个问题很简单，就是因为他懒，那么这就是一个隐藏的梦想表现出来的迹象。随后你需要判断自己在和什么样的梦想做搏斗。揭示一个梦想是一种挑战，只有你和配偶的友谊足够深厚，深藏不露的梦想才有可能自动显现。因此，必须先达成前三个# 法则才行。在这之后，你们需要进行一次非常深入的交流。首先，你们需要写下关于这个问题（梦想）你对自己立场的解释（不要批评或责备配偶），关注自己的需求和希望，讲述立场背后的隐藏的梦想的故事，解释它们来自哪里以及对你为什么对你有意义。然后，参考第五章“解决可解决问题的步骤”进行讨论。 法则七：创造共同意义（彼此尊重梦想）夫妻双方可能不认同对方的某些梦想，但可以尊重它们。尊重配偶的梦想有三个不同的层次：第一个层次是你能向配偶表示你理解他的这个梦想，即使你不赞同它，你也能对它感兴趣、想知道更多的东西；第二个层次是为她的梦想提供财力支持；第三个层次是成为这个梦想的一部分。和谐的婚姻要至少能做到第一个层次。另外，在可以进行情感联系的时刻，创造一些非正式的仪式也可以增加家庭成员间的共同意义感 结语没有哪本书（或哪个治疗师）能解决你所有的婚姻问题，但是，在婚姻生活中运用这7个# 法则，你真的可以改变婚姻的航向。即使：只对你的婚姻轨道做很小的、很轻微的改动，随着时间的流逝，这个改动也能给婚姻带来巨大的、积极的影响。当然，条件是你必须做出改变并让它得以延续。改善你的婚姻好比是一次旅行，与所有的旅行一样，开始是不相信，只跨出一小步，在看清自己所处的位置后，再跨出下一步。如果你卡住了或是迈错了步，重新阅读本书的相关中章节，审视自己目前的婚姻状况，你可以知道如何使婚姻沿着正确的方向前进。 其他： 50%的离婚发生在结婚后的头7年（占全部婚姻的1/3左右） 大部分外遇不是离婚的原因，而是感情破裂后的自然结果。大部分记录过婚外情的治疗师都发现，这些幽会通常与性无关，而是在寻求友谊、支持、理解、尊重、注意以及关心，这些原本是婚姻应该提供的东西。 随着越来越多的女性进入职场，现在女性婚外情的比率也已经不逊于男性 人们往往认为一段好的婚姻是理所当然的，而不是需要培育、值得重视和迫切需要的，就像是人们对待恋情的态度一样。 挑起棘手的婚姻话题的人80%多是妻子，而她们的丈夫却试图回避它们。这不是婚姻不幸的征兆，大部分幸福的婚姻也有同样的情形。 85%的婚姻中，丈夫都是冷战者，这不是因为男人缺失了某些部分，其缘由在于我们的进化遗产。自然选择赐予女性在感受到压力后能迅速抚慰自己并冷静下来的能力，女性·这种保持镇定的能力能让她们产出更多的乳汁，从而提高孩子的生存概率。对那些早期的合作狩猎人来说，保持警惕是一项重要的生存技能，因此，男性的肾上腺素很容易被释放·出来，而且男人不容易冷静的特性使他们更有可能生存下来，繁衍后代。 直到今天，与女性相比，男性的心血管系统仍然更易被激活，而且在遭受压力后恢复起来比女性慢（这是否意味着男性更有可能患心血管疾病以及PTSD？）。因此，妻子天·生能更好地处理压力，提出敏感问题，丈夫无法处理问题，他避免自己卷入其中。 丈夫希望一周多做几次爱，但妻子认为一两次就足够了，结果丈夫觉得很沮丧，他觉得自己被妻子拒绝了 当你通过埋葬梦想来适应婚姻生活时，这个梦想只不过是陷入僵局的冲突后重新出现在你面前。 人类的天性决定了，除非你觉得对方理解你，否则你几乎不可能接受对方的建议。只有人们感到自己被别人喜欢和接受，他们才会改变自己的行为，当人们觉得自己被别人批评、厌恶及不被别人赏识时，他们就不可能改变,相反，他们会觉得自己被围攻从而努力保护自己。所以在你要求配偶改变之前，你必须让配偶觉得你理解他。 努力培养这样一种观点：在你婚姻生活的范围内，所有的希望．想象幻想和欲望都是可接受的，没有什么东西本质上就是坏的或是令人厌恶的，你可以对配偶的请求说不，但不能贬低配偶的请求，。表达性幻想需要大量的 信任因此，当你听说配偶有—个性幻想时，请注意亲切地对待它。如果这一个幻想不是你自己的，而它又不是一条歧路，那么你可以赞同这个幻想；如果配偶希望你伪装成一个陌生人、护士或海盗，不要把这当成是人格问题，只要考虑该怎么演。即使是提出要求的一方也常常不能完全理解这些想法、渴望或幻想，没有人知道为什么一些特别的幻想对某些人来说是色情的，它们只是幻想而已]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[睡眠革命]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-12-05-Book-HowToSleep%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[作者是尼克·利特尔黑尔斯，英国睡眠协会前任会长和运动睡眠教练，服务过不少的顶尖职业运动员。他在书中提出了一个新的R90睡眠方案，提出修复睡眠的七大关键指标。 1、形成规律睡眠尽量在白天的时候，多晒太阳，通过自然光来调整睡眠。在入睡前少用或不用电子产品，比如手机、ipad、电视之灰的产品。可以通过可穿戴设备来了解你的睡眠节奏和规则。虽然现在有各种手环或智能手表，真正靠谱的没有多少，数据失真很大，基本上就记录下睡眠时间。虽然有sleepcycle、sleepbetter、Sleep++之类的睡眠APP，但使用起来还是有些不便。个人推荐 Apple Watch + AutoSleep，能做到自动化记录，并且数据精度比较好，但睡觉时戴Apple Watch有点不太习惯。睡眠质量最高的时间段是凌晨2-3点，不要日出之后去睡觉，会打乱生物钟。 2、睡眠类型去了解自己的睡眠类型，有猫头鹰、云雀和中间类，不同的睡眠类型会相差2小时左右。实际上大多数人都知道自己的睡眠类型。别咖啡成瘾，每天的咖啡因摄入不要超过400毫克。想形成规律的睡眠，就不要在周末睡懒觉。根据个人习惯来规划行程和安排事务.学会尊重另一半的睡眠类型，要适应，少去改变。 3、90分钟睡眠法睡眠是90分钟为周期，睡眠时间是90分钟的倍数时效果最好。可以自动选择入睡时间，但入睡时间取决于起床时间。一天晚上睡眠不好没事，但不要连续三个晚上睡眠不足，后果会形成累加效应，会让你的方方面面，努力做到每周有四天以上，获得理想的睡眠时间。每周35个睡眠周期效果最好，28-30个也行，再少的话，会让你过于疲劳。 4、睡眠前后的仪式以前写过睡前和睡后的仪式文章，可以去阅读一些。这些仪式能让你更快进入睡眠或者更快的清醒。不要起床后立刻看手机，早上洗个温水浴能让你快速清醒，并精神起来。不要把杂七八糟的东西都放到卧室，整理好它，也能让你更容易入睡。 5、日间小睡当你夜间缺少一个睡眠周期时，可以利用下午1-3点时来补充.要么30分钟，要么90分钟，这两个时间段的睡眠能让你恢复精力。还可以使用冥想或正念来恢复精力，每隔90分钟休息一下，能让你的注意力坚持更长时间。 6、睡眠套装最好的睡眠姿势是胎儿姿势，躺向非主要身体一侧。就是惯用左手的向右侧睡，惯用右手的向左侧睡。你要检测床垫，了解什么样的床垫对自己更适合。不要一下买过于昂贵的床垫，可以考虑购买经常换洗的床垫。睡眠时的温度很重要，比当前温度低一点能更让你更快入睡。买床的时候，能买多大就买多只要能放得上。在床上用品上多花点钱，买低过敏性的材质。作者建议用人造材质的床上用品或者300支上下的埃及棉，最好定期的除螨。我自己买过很多不同的枕头，从几百到数千，目前用的水枕，可以自动调节硬度，让我的颈椎很舒服。 7、睡眠环境清空你的房间，最好的情况是只把睡眠、修复和休息所必需的东西放到房间。这一点，国内很难做到，基本上衣橱都会放到卧室。窗帘要能隔离外部光线，这样就不会干扰你睡眠了。提示一下这样的窗帘都比较厚，而且也比较贵，我的卧室窗帘花了不少钱，当时超出预算，现在觉得很值得。保持卧室的洁净，避免任何能刺激大脑的东西，要能给你带来安全感。别把手机放到卧室里，特别不要放到身边。房间温度在16-18摄氏度是最理想的，尽量让卧室里的温度比其它房间低一点。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[第三选择 解读所有难题的关键思维]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-12-04-Book-ThirdAlternative%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[“你不能用攥紧的拳头握手”——协同解决问题 在《第3选择》一书的结尾，史蒂芬•柯维写道：“身为第3选择思维者，你的成功会由内而外，你越是要处理重大议题，你就越需要更多的内在意志与力量。”这正是我读过此书之后的感受。在这本管理学著作中，具体、真实的案例不胜枚举，我惊叹于史蒂芬大师“第3”理论的缜密思维与极强的可行性，并对书中在工作和生活中遇到疑难问题的指引心怀感激。 一是协同原理。之前听过台湾铭传大学杨志弘教授一节课，他也提到了“协同”。协同，即是两个或两个以上的人，放弃不解与成见，以真诚、合作的态度共同迎接挑战，解决问题。我想这也是史蒂芬大师第3选择思维中最核心的内容。相较于“我的方法”或者“你的方法”，站在协同合作角度的“我们的方法”发挥的作用往往更大。但正像书中所说的，当代人真正理解协同这个概念并付诸实践的人少之又少，被普遍偷换概念导致其不受重视是其主要原因之一。特别是如今的80、90后年轻人，因为愈加优越的成长环境和太急于证明自己，常常对外在事物处于防御心态，在处理工作和生活中的冲突时，时常过于自我，漠视对方感受，难以与之协同。然而，协同是一个奇迹。从自然法则到商业经营，从小到无数水滴形成的美丽雪花，音乐中美好音符的和旋，到配合得当的球队，难以战胜的民族……协同得到的结果远远高于个体取得的成就。 二是从“我们”的角度找方法。优秀的领导者总是视冲突为沃土而非毒药。在史蒂芬大师所说的“我看到你”、“我知道你”、“我找到你”的思维模式中，以“我”的视线站在“你”的立场，主动去理解对方、体会对方，而非忽视和排斥，用同理心倾听，这是达到和平和协同的关键，是“第3”法则的精华。事情行不通了、问题繁琐、被吃了闭门羹……从“我们”的角度找方法，能够激发我们更深层次的思考，以双向的目的解决问题，达成统一。当个体意识并做到“我的发言权杖现在交给你了”，意味着我可以通过你的问题，找到我们共同的问题，然后等你把“发言权杖”再交给我时，你也可以得到我的不同观点，以及我们遇到的困难，这在无形中让我们站在同一战线，化解彼此间的误会和危机。从“我们”的角度找方法，不仅仅是一种思维方式，更是一个解决问题切实可行的办法，无论对于家庭、企业、国家、社会均奏效。 回到文章开头，生活中的矛盾无处不在，“第3选择”也同样无处不在。然而，能够发掘第3 选择很容易，能将本书读得透彻并活学活用，成为一个可以与人产生协同合作的伙伴很难。拥有第3选择思维的人，必须放弃以思考独立个体为重，这需要足够的勇气，势在必得的心态，和持之以恒的意志。片面的讲，有时坚持第3选择不能将个人利益最大化，但无论如何，在生活及事业上遇到问题的时候，从对方角度出发，趋于协同的化解问题解决争端，远比持续的争吵和彼此算计更有意义。]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-12-01-Book-HowToWork%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[稻盛和夫前辈在这本书中阐述了他的劳动观和工作观。结合自己的亲身经历，向读者们回答了这些问题： 我们为什么要工作，工作的好处和作用何在？ 我们就应以什么样的态度投入工作？ 在工作中设立“高目标”，并且持续付出不亚于任何人的努力，具体就应如何做？ 为什么说“持续就是力量”，怎样才能做到？ 怎样才能出色地工作？ 怎样创造性地工作？ 稻盛说： 工作能够锻炼人性、磨砺心智，工作是人最尊贵、最重要、最有价值的行为。 获得心中快乐的前提是劳动。每一天认真工作，努力获得回报，才能让你感受到人生的快乐和时间的可贵。拼命工作的背后隐藏着快乐和欢喜，正像漫漫长夜结束后，曙光就会到来一样。 与其寻找自己喜欢的工作，不如先喜欢上已有的工作，脚踏实地，从眼前开始。寻找自己喜欢的工作，往往就像寻找一座空中楼阁;与其追求幻想，还不如先爱上眼前的工作。 想要成功就务必拼命工作，想要生存就务必付出“不亚于任何人的努力”。 专心致志于一行一业，不腻烦、不焦躁，埋头苦干，你的人生就会开出美丽的花，结出丰硕的果实。 “竭尽全力、拼命工作”，再加上“天天反省”，才能为你的完美主义画上最美的句号。抑制“自我”，释放“真我”，让利他之心活跃起来，这样的作业就是“反省”。这样，我们的灵魂就会被净化，就会变得更美丽，更高尚。 即使是平凡简单的工作，只要不断地钻研创新，也会带来飞跃性的进步。在每一天的工作中时刻思考“这样做是否可行”，带着“为什么”的疑问，这天胜过昨日，明天胜过这天，持续不断地对工作进行改善和改良，最终必须能取得出色的成就。]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-11-30-Book-HistoryOfTomorrow%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[幸福感：人类的任何一种情感需求都有饱和度，一旦摄取过量，将会导致物极必反。人很容易在快感上瘾中失去对生活的动力和追求，乃至绝望。再好吃的食物如果一日三餐的吃也会厌倦。 生物也是算法：人可以通过学习和实践积累经验，丰富的知识和经验能够总结产生出“算法”，这种算法也可以称之为我们的“本能直觉”。这种“直觉”夹杂了人类的七情六欲，它可以帮助人类理解世界并主导行动。人随着不断学习和实践可以优化自己的这种“算法”。实际列子就是我们常会依靠“常识”来判断新生事物，这种“常识”有时就是一种“直觉”。 意识和道德理论：人需要通过道德伦理来建立除法律以外的社会秩序，这是人本性所致。确定性的秩序和共同价值观可以让人获得安全感，而这个过程往往也会扼杀社会中的“非主流群体”。而人工智能是否需要具备跟人一样的意识和道德理论目前是一个争论点。我个人的理解是争论点在于人工智能是否单纯以“机器工具”的概念存在还是带有人类特质。 人类的互联三观：人类的社会是一种想象共同体，这种想象共同体可以形成国家、宗教等等。当这个群体大规模协作的时候能够促进社会高速发展，但同时也会弱化每个人类个体。 智人的统治：人类种群不断强大的同时也在压缩着其他物种的生存空间。结果将是要么与人类共存，要么灭亡。 宗教和科学：人的本质需求中有着很强烈的“解读世界”的需求。也就是“合理”解释这个世界中一切发生的事物，这种需求与生俱来。科学和宗教的诞生和发展都是为了寻求真理并更好的解释世界上发生的一切事物。 人文主义时代：人文主义最大的价值在于更加开放的价值观和尊重每个独立的个体。一句话总结：尊重和鼓励世界的多样性。 所谓的自由意志： 人类因为很多时候无法准确掌握自己的潜意识，加上与生俱来的情感因素，因此完全可以被人为或者AI制造出来的“事实”或者“意义”所影响。简单案例就是假设某搜索引擎每天只给你推送它想让你了解到的新闻，那么不久之后你对世界的认知就是一个完全由机器“臆造”出来的世界。袁世凯曾经在不知情的情况下，每天读为其“量身定制”的报纸，不久就决定称帝了，呵呵哒。 人类vs人工智能 (机器): 机器本身不存在人类那样的生理限制，随着科技的发展，机器将会逐渐超越人类智能，并且存在机器消灭人类的风险。未来的人类精英可以通过花钱来对自己进行“改造升级”，“超人类”的诞生恐怕只是一个时间问题，呵呵哒。 意识的海洋：科技人文主义认为如果想要抵抗人工智能，那么人本身必须通过科技提升智能，“超人类”在未来将会出现。但是整个社会的发展趋势不会被改变，整体逐渐强化，而个体不断弱化。在数据主义的理论中，科技不仅可以让资源集中合理再分配，人的意志同样也可以。这里不得不提类似网络搜索引擎这样的工具带给了我们生活上的无限便捷，但各国政府也时刻担心它某天是否会通过构建一个完全背离真实的虚假世界误导群众意志。]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-11-27-Book-HowGoogleWorks%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[读完《重新定义公司：谷歌是如何运营的》，脑中对管理的固有观念恐怕要进行一次拆除和重建了。 对于项目管理，一般有纵向和横向管理。纵向管理，即如一般传统的职能部门的管理。而横向管理，与其说是管理，更多的其实是一种协作。而《重新定义公司》所提到的“创意精英管理”，个人理解是对“横向管理”的进一步演化。 “创意精英管理”的基础，组成团队的成员必须是“精英”。这些精英，不仅个人专业领域的能力和综合能力比较强外，主观能动性也非常的强。管理一个这样的团队，可能管理工作更偏向于管理精英团队所在的环境而不是人，而且作为管理者本身首先也要是精英。管理者与团队成员一些协作主要发挥的可能是其领导力。书中，对创意精英的基本特质做了描述，即：具备商业头脑、专业知识、创造力以及实践经验。 书中提到的彼得.德鲁克对过去200年来的组织创新的总结，个人认为相当精辟。彼得.德鲁克把过去200年的组织创新总结为3次革命： 第一次是工业革命(industrial revolution)，核心是机器取代了体力，技术(technology)超越了技能(skill)。 第二次是生产力革命（productivity revolution），大致从1880年到第二次世界大战，核心是以泰勒为代表的科学管理的普及，工作被知识化，强调的是标准化、可度量等概念。公司这种新组织正是随着科学管理思想的发展而兴起的。 第三次是管理革命(management revolution)，知识成为超越资本和劳动力的最重要的生产要素。和体力劳动者相比，知识工作者是否努力工作很难被直接观察和测量，相应地、管理的重心转向激励，特别是动机的匹配(incentive alignment)。期权激励是这20年高科技企业大发展最主要的组织创新。 沿着这个思路，我们面临的时代可称为第四次革命，即“创意革命(creative revolution)”。从互联网到移动互联网，再到物联网，从云计算到大数据，未来商业的一个基本特征已经非常清楚，那就是基于机器学习的人工智能将成为未来商业的基础。未来社会最优价值的人：有创造力、洞察力、对客户的感知力。 科学技术进步所带来的每一次更新换代，就如同项目管理的过程组一样，是交叠进行的。所以，传统的管理模式，尤其是某些行业还会存在比较长的一段时间，但我个人认为，随着这个社会人才素质的提高，“精英管理”的模式是一个趋势。 所以，作为管理者只是一味地磨练“管理技巧”是远远不够的。为了能够很好的适应未来社会的生存，每个人都需要不断磨练自己的专业技能，同时不忘提到自己的综合能力。如此，即便是离开了组织，作为一个独立的个体来面对整个世界的市场，你也可以很好地生存下去。 读书笔记： 一、文化：相信自己的口号1、保持扁平有一种矛盾，几乎所有企业都难逃其优：虽然人人都声称希望通过扁平式结构拉近与上级之间的距离，但实际上，多数人仍然从心底希望等级制度延续下去。而创意精英们则不然，他们之所以渴望扁平的企业结构，并不是因为他们想与上层平起平坐，而是因为他们希望多干实事，因此需要加深与决策者之间的沟通。 2、贝佐斯的“两个披萨”原则组织应该由小规模的团队构成。亚马逊创始人杰夫·贝佐斯曾对“两个披萨”原则推崇备至，这个原则规定，团队人数不能多到个两披萨还吃不饱。小团队要比大团队更有效率，他们不会花那么多时间勾心斗角。小团队亲如家人，大家可能会起口角、争对错甚至闹分裂，但往往能在紧要关头团结一致。 3、组织要以最有影响力的人物为中心一条至关重要的原则是：找出最有影响力的人物，组织就以此人为中心。不要把岗位或经验作为选择管理者的标尺，而要看他的表现和热情。工作表现比较容易衡量，但热情比较难以评估。热情是卓越领导者与生俱来的特质，这种人即便自己不主动请缨也会被别人推到领导位置上，他们身上的热情就像磁铁吸引铁屑一般把人们聚焦到自己的身边。苹果公司的前HR曾说过这样一句话：“你的头衔可以让你成为管理者，但让你成为领导者的，是你的员工。” 4、营造说“好”的企业氛围“我能喝苏打水吗？”不行。“一勺冰淇淋不够，我可以要两勺吗？”不行。“我的作业还没做完，但我能先看会儿电视吗？”不行。大家条件反射式般说“不”的习惯对孩子来说特别恼人，久而久之，他就不愿意问了，他要么偷偷进行，要么干脆再也不尝试。这种“万事都说不”的毛病也悄然蔓延到职场上。在给出否定答案时，企业往往会设置重重障碍，通过繁冗的程序、层层的审批和一场场讨论会，用“冷暴力”说“不”。“不”对于创意精英而言简直就是当头一棒，这表明企业已然失去成立之初的活力，披上了过于形式化的外衣。在遭遇一次次“不”的重重打击后，创意精英们便不再多费口舌，开始盘算着另谋高就了。 二、战略：你的计划是错误的作者敢百分之百打包票：只要你有商业计划，那你的计划一定是错误的。只要是MBA式的商业计划，无论经过怎样的深思熟虑，一定在某些方面存在硬伤。因此，风险投资家应永远遵守投团队而不投计划的准则。既然计划会错，那人就得对。成功的团队懂得如何发现计划中的瑕疵，并及时作出调整。 那么新创企业在没有计划的情况下该如何吸引优秀人才和其他重要资源（比如资金）呢？实际上，制定计划无可厚非，但是要明白，随着你对产品和市场了解的加深及事业的发展，计划也要随之做出调整。要取得成功，除了对计划及时反复调整之外，我们还需注意制定计划的基础。互联网时代为科技和社会结构带来的剧变，让我们从学校和职场中学到的一些曾经广为接受的战略原理变得不再适用。因此，你的计划虽然可以调整，但必须以合乎现金社会运作方式的基本原理为基础，并在转型时以这些原理为指导。计划可变，基础应该岿然不动。 计划的无常可能会让一些想加入团队的人望而却步，因为绝大部分人都不喜欢不确定性。而创意精英与一般人不同，他们就爱自己动脑筋想对策。所以，无需太担心调整计划对团队建设的影响。 三、人才：招聘是你最重要的工作1、对于管理者来说，“工作中最重要的事情”是招聘人才物色人才就好比刮胡子：如果你不每天下功夫，别人就会看出来。对于谷歌来说，无论是面试初级工程师还是高级总经理，谷歌的面试官都会认真投入大量时间和精力，尽其所能地为谷歌引入顶尖人才。 2、羊群效应优质人才组成的员工团队不仅能做出令人满意的成绩，还能吸引更多优质人才的加入。顶尖的员工团队就像一个羊群，也就是说，人与人之间是互相效仿的。你只要招到几个优质人才，就会有一大群优质人才跟过来。谷歌以顶尖的环境和设施而著称，但大多数创意精英选择谷歌，是因为他们想要与顶尖的创意精英共事。 3、雇用学习型动物在招聘时不要太看重应聘者掌握了多少知识，而要重视他们尚未开发的潜力。当今，信息技术正在呈指数级发展，但人们对未来的直觉并不呈指数级跟进，而是线性的。根据作者的经验，非凡的智慧是所有“指数级思考者”的首要条件。想要衡量人们对变化的处理能力如何，智慧是一个绝好的指标。但智慧并非唯一的标准。有很多聪颖过人的人，在面对变幻莫测的“过山车”时，却选择了乘坐自己熟悉的“转转杯”。在面对那些令人揪心的上下颠簸，他们只会一味地选择规避。亨利·福特说过：“不管你是20岁还是80岁，只要停止学习，就说明你老了。坚持学习的人则永远保持年轻。人生中最大的乐事，莫过于保持头脑青春永驻。”理想的人才，应该是那些勇于乘坐过山车且学习不辍的人。这些“学习型动物”不仅有处事不惊的智慧，也有乐于享受变化的心态。这些人拥有“成长型思维”，会不断为自己拟定“学习目标”，这些目标鼓励他们勇于挑战，有助于他们积累更多的知识、攀登更高的山峰。 4、客观评价人才我们常常听别人说，想找那种可以一起小酌一杯的人共事。但其实，往往最有效率的一些同事，恰恰是你最不想一起把酒言欢的人。和不喜欢的人共事不可避免，因为一家公司全体员工不应该千篇一律，千篇一律恰恰是失败的温床。 5、加大光圈甄选人才所谓“光圈”，就是相机上一个允许光线进入内感光面以捕捉画面的装置。一般招聘经理的“光圈”非常小，他们只招聘高学历或者有经验的人才。然而，有洞见的管理者会把光圈调大，将那些被一般标准排除在外的人也纳入考虑范围。 6、面试是最重要的技巧最理想的面试过程，就像好友之间的知性对话（比如“你现在在读哪些书？”）。你的问题应该深刻而广泛，问题的答案应是开放的（以此来试探出应聘者的思维模式），且要留出反驳的余地（这样，你就可以看看应聘者是如何捍卫和辩护自己的观点的）。 7、给优秀人才超出常规的回报没错，高人就是要有高薪。成功的运动员拥有特殊的技艺，能带来非凡的杠杆效应。如果他们发挥得好，带来的影响力也是超出常规的，他们能带动团队取胜。优秀的创意精英也是如此。如果你希望顶尖的员工能拿出更加优异的表现，那就用超出常规的薪酬来做嘉奖和激励。但吸引创意精英的因素，不应只限于金钱，还应有大展身手的机会、并肩作战的同事、肩上的责任和享有的机遇、激发灵感的企业文化和价值观等等。 四、决策：共识的真正含义1、用数据做决策最了解数据的人，是那些工作在第一线的员工，而往往不是管理层。作为管理者，我们要注意不要迷失在无法理解的细节中，而要信赖那些为你工作的人，相信他们会把问题搞明白。 2、谨防“摇头娃娃”的附和要想达成最有利于公司的决策，就需要有异议存在。人们必须在开放的环境里阐述自己的观点并互相辩驳，如果不把所有观点都开诚布公地逐一讨论，那么大家只会表里不一地称是，一离开会议室便会把自己的表态抛之脑后。因此，要想达成真正的共识，意见的分歧不可少。巴顿将军曾经说过：“如果人人想的都一样，那一定是有人没有思考。”如果你招人有方，那好消息是：如果各个级别之间有意见分歧，那就说明你的人员在动脑子思考。最好的决策应该是正确的决策，而不是竭力争取大家一致同意而找出的最低标准，也未必是领导人自己的决策。 3、决策者的职责就是准确地拿捏时机把乐于行动的劲头拿出来，中止没有意义的讨论和分析，让团队行动起来，为实施决策而团结一致。但要注意，不要成为紧迫感的奴隶。在最后一刻到来之前，都要保持灵活变通。因为，偏重行动可能会使人未经周密考虑就草率做出决策，因此可能带来不利影响，故耐心也很重要。 五、沟通：当最牛的路由器1、信息分享许多商业人士之所以升到管理层职位，“靠的并不是他们所表现出来的团队合作精神，而是因为他们深谙与同事们的竞争之道。而这样的风气，只会助长人们对信息的霸占”。如果雇用员工只是为了让他们执行工作，那么这种钳制消息的传播方式可能还能有效，但在互联网时代，我们雇用员工是让他们进行思考的。在互联网时代，对企业来说，信息才是真正的生命之源。要在21世纪建议一家企业，吸引创意精英并引导他们大展宏图才是成功的关键。但创意精英若不能接触大量的信息，这一切只是空谈。现在，最有能力的管理者不但不独霸信息，还会分享信息。比尔·盖茨说过：“力量并不来自掌握的知识，而是来自分享的知识。” 2、掌握细节“身而为人，在于提出问题，而非回答问题。”谷歌的首席运营官埃里克很认真地贯彻这个理念。在偶遇一位许久不见的高管时，简单的寒暄过后，埃里克便会开门见山地提问：“你最近的工作进展如何？遇到了哪些问题？应该交付的产品进度是怎样的？”这些问题的效果有两重：不仅让埃里克掌握了对方的业务细节，还让他知道哪些高管掌握了他们的业务细节。如果业务负责人不能再10秒钟内把遇到的重大困难流畅地说出来，那么此人就不胜任。如今，“事不关己”的管理方法已经不再适用，作为管理者，必须掌握细节。 六、创新：缔造原始的混沌1、创新是什么？创新的东西不仅需要新的功能，还需要出人意料。如果你的产品只是满足了消费者提出的需求，那么你就不是创新，你只是做出回应。创新的东西不仅要新颖、出人意料，还要非常实用。 2、70/20/10原则即把70%的资源配置给核心业务，20%分配给新兴产品，10%投在全新产品。这个原则确保核心业务占有大部分资源，蓬勃发展得新兴业务可享受一定的投资，而与此同时，异想天开的疯狂构想也得到一定程度的支持，以防成为不可避免的预算削减的牺牲品。10%的资源并不算多，但也合理，因为如果在新的理念上投入过多，一旦后期失败，大家会更不甘心，不愿意舍弃。过度投资会让大家产生固执的偏见。 3、20%时间制谷歌的“20%时间”工作方式，允许工程师拿出20%的时间来研究自己喜欢的项目。无论你想把这“20%时间”花在何处，只要不妨碍你的正常工作，那就没有人能阻止你忙自己的事。这个制度，实践了乔布斯那句“要以创意为准则，不要奉等级为圭臬”的格言。 4、交付，迭代伏尔泰曾经说：“完美是优秀的敌人。”乔布斯也说过：“能交付才是真正的艺术家。”新想法不可能一出炉就完美无缺，你也没有时间等到想法完美的那一天。打造一款产品，投放市场，看看反响如何，设计并加以改进，再重新投入市场。这就是交付和迭代，在此方面眼疾手快的公司，才能成为赢家。 写在后面：读书笔记写到这里就结束了，在写的过程中，又简略地看了一遍书。与第一遍从头看到尾不同的是，第二篇是选择性地阅读我所感兴趣的东西。任何事情都有个“二八原则”，第二遍看的就是“八”，整理出来的内容也属于“八”的部分。但写完还想从头到尾细细再看几遍，好书理应如此。推荐大家阅读，相信我，这本书值得你阅读。]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-11-24-Book-WangYangMinZhuan%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[阳明心学作为哲学思想体系，内含着数项“矛盾性”范畴。诸如：“知”与“行”，“顿悟”与“渐修”，“本体”与“功夫”,“简易”与“精微”，“天理”与“人欲”等。阳明心学的伟大之处，即是“以二化一”的辩证思维，把“超凡入圣”修炼之道的窗户纸捅破了。 一，“知”与“行”“知行合一”的原意是“知行本一”。即，“知行原是两个字说一个功夫”。阳明先生曾引用人身感应为例来解释知行合一：“如好好色，如恶恶臭。见好色是知，好好色是行。只见那好色时，已自好了，不是见了后，又立个心去好”。“知行合一”的重心在“行”，而非“知”。这是一种实践主义的知行观。阳明先生的“知”，既是知识之知，也是智慧之知，更是良知之知。知识是以物观之，智慧是以道观之，良知是以心观之。若以三物比拟，知识犹如满腹经纶的“老翁”;智慧则像校正目标的”准星”；良知就是观照万物的“明镜”。阳明先生的“行”则是指个别性的一举一动。由于“一念发动处即是行”，这里“行”所包含的范围也很广，心中萌发的意念也是“行” 二，“顿悟”与“渐修”“顿悟”与“渐修”是“超凡入圣”的两种不同途径。阳明先生一生有过多次的“顿悟”实践，可是他主张的入圣方法却是以“渐修”为主。因为“顿悟”是非常有用的，但不是人人可为的， 也不是必须要有的；“渐修”则是不能缺少的，也是常人都可为的。“悟”不一定非要“顿”，也可以通过“渐修”而来。所谓“渐修渐悟”不是不承认“顿悟”，而是融会“悟”与“修”。著名的“四句教”就有重悟的“四无说”与重修的“四有说”两种诠释。阳明先生告诫弟子，前者适于导上根人，因而“不宜轻以示人”；后者适于导中根以下人，尽可广为传播。事实上，“渐修渐悟”的最终结果也会是“顿悟”。因为“开悟“只在“一刹那”。犹如一个人要到北京，可以乘飞机、高铁、汽车等多种交通工具，也可步行。无论怎么去，进入北京那一刻就是一刹那的事儿。说悟容易“证”悟难。一个人凭什么说自己得悟，说自己已近圣境？阳明先生认为整个人生就是一本经书，得悟的凭据就是其人格本身。他在人“心”中发现了超然的“本体”。这本体既是天地万物的汇源处，又是入圣的动力与成圣的目的。所以，阳明先生以此“心之本体”代表圣学的凭据与权威。 三，“本体”与“功夫”阳明先生的“本体即功夫”，是对中国哲学思想的重大贡献。全世界的古代哲学家都在探求天地万物背后的本原及其相互关系。西方哲学称作“真理与现象”；印度哲学称作“实相与幻相”；中国哲学则称作“本体与功夫”。他在寻求入圣方法中，从“功夫”找到了“本体”，于人心内发现了内在的超然体—良知本体。良知犹如舟车的指南针、医者的奇方秘诀，佛教的心印、道教的灵丹；而良知本体则是整个宇宙的主宰。人心也是天地万物之心，天地万物因“心”而成为一体。人心自然能明觉得天理，也不烦再有所谓功夫了。简言之，阳明先生的本体就是“良知”，功夫就是“致良知”。它既是良知的建立，也是良知的呈现，即“知行合一”。 “心无内外”，做功夫须在“事上磨炼”，磨炼自己一心的喜怒哀乐，磨炼自己良知的感应，便是磨炼“心之本体”。所以，日常工作、生活即修行。“致良知”的过程，就是不断去除私欲，回归初心的践行。 四，“简易”与“精微”阳明哲学既“简易”又“精微”。诚如阳明先生所言：“此道至简至易的，亦至精至微的。”因其简易，所以易为大众接受，跟随者众多；因其精微，真正掌握其精髓者甚少，甚至被指责为“玄”。 阳明哲学的简易一面，体现在圆通性，“一即一切，一切即一”，圆融透澈，无可分离；而其精微的一面则体现在“活”，即要靠体验、靠用功。致良知是活生生、活泼泼的哲学，所以有不变的一面，更有多变的一面。“此道本无穷尽，发挥愈多，精微愈显”。阳明先生哲学思想的展开是由浅入深、由粗到细、由里而外的；但其思维模式不是直线性而是螺旋性的，不是平面封闭而是多维开放的；他的“心一元论”，将无数的不同概念，通过“良知”宗旨，化多为一。其方法论是“以一心明万理，而化万理为一心”，又从不同角度观心说心。化繁为简，直抵本质是阳明心学的精髓，但这个“简”又是极有深度、顺应万变的。 五，“天理”与“人欲”“天理”与“人欲”，是整个中国哲学史上关于伦理道德与物质欲望之间关系的范畴，也一直是一个热门话题。阳明先生认为，人心即是道心，即是良知，即是天理。“心之本体”是天地万物的汇源处，也是人欲的汇源处。天理就在人欲之中，合乎良知或恰如其分的人欲就是天理。即“此心无私欲之蔽，即是天理”。心是众善之源，也是知觉与道德的根，并拥有使人入圣的能力。但这并非说“心无不善”，而是说心有治不善的本事。阳明先生将心与太阳相比，就如太阳自然发光，只有受遮时才变暗。人心也一样，只有受私情所障时才失明。他也喜欢用“镜子”来比心，圣人之心如明镜，常人之心如昏镜。“超凡入圣”之功夫就是“磨镜”。若“去其私，无不明矣”。关于“天理”与“人欲”，当今社会有一个流传甚广的错误说法：“天理即是人欲”。初见于超级畅销书《明朝那些事儿》（我一直认为是“天理即在人欲”的笔误），近见于介绍某知名企业家管理秘诀的文章。由于其影响较大，似有澄清之必要。天理固然在人欲之中，但绝不能说“天理即是人欲”，犹如道在万物之中，但不能说“道即是万物”。人欲即有天理，也有私欲，私欲就绝不是天理。而“存天理”则必须“去私欲”。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[从用户出发，并且要落地； 做别人没做的事情，宽容对待失败； （一个点）做到极致。 用户不会在乎你的七大功能，八大特色，只要有一个功能可以打动他，可以解决它心中的痛，或者挠去他心中的痒，那你就有可能获得用户的信赖。 不要给用户谈你们公司有多少个院士，多少个千人计划，多少个专家，多少个博士，你们的产品用到了多fancy的技术，大部分人不会care的.最显然的就是这种科技新闻下的评论数量几乎为0. 你做了一个新产品，然后你给用户说我用到了最高精尖的Deep Learning技术，通过利用人工神经网络模拟人脑神经的层次化结构实现更加高效精准识别，他们才不会在乎.而当他们用一个图片软件发现自己和裴勇俊的相似度高达90%时，他们会发朋友圈，发微博来推广这个软件. 虽然这种产品有典型的一次性特征. 用户总是第一位的，老毛也许是对的，深入群众看来确实是个“法宝”。 不要尝试着去策划卖点，鼓噪卖相（宣传你的七大功能，八大特征）。就一个问题，用户用的时候觉得“爽”了么？ 用户不会在乎你的操作系统融入了各种各样眼花缭乱的云技术，而当开机时间突然降到了8s，他们可能会喜大普奔，交口称赞，口碑就这样建立起来了。 你连世界都没有观过，哪来的世界观？同样，你连用户的信任都没有争取到，哪来的谈格局、谈布局、谈平台的自信？别说正确的废话了，务实点吧！ 人才培养工程的“5年一周期，每周期投入培养经费5000W，两院院士做导师，最终培养出100个乔布斯”战略规划沦落成了笑柄，乔布斯不是种出来的。万一不小心培养出来了，请记住齐白石那句话“学我者生，似我者死”。 我们嘴巴上喊着创新，创新一旦出来，却开始对它进行价值批判，进而压制创新。而一旦成功，则立马跪舔捧其为神。请多点包容心和原则吧。 真正的创新就是颠覆和破坏。Google没有多少通信领域核心的专利和技术，这不妨碍它低价把曾经的通信帝国企业摩托罗拉买入，把专利抽干后甩给联想；诺基亚的遭遇也一样。 用户是核心，产品定位于为用户解决问题的工具。所以务必关注这几个问题：解决了什么问题（严重，一般的，一次性的，根本就不是问题），怎么解决（一键式还是像诺基亚那样为了申请个开发者账户托关系还要耗上半年时间安装个软件还要弄懂软件签名让人产生额外的心理负担）。 互联网让消费者具备了更多的知情权和选择权，让信息更加对称，传统的一锤子买卖的思维方式不再适用。产品卖给用户之后，你才正式和用户开始打交道。 注重用户体验，细节决定成败。 在用你的产品时，不要让用户思考，不要让用户纠结，不要让用户有心理负担。多站在用户角度看问题。 产品的功能可分为强需求和弱需求。 三个在产品设计时不一定正确的假设：第一，假设某个功能，用户一定需要；第二，假设某个功能用户一定知道它存在；第三，假设用户一定按照设计方式使用。 要脸皮厚，不要怕人骂；要有强大的可以听取建议的内心，不要有玻璃心。 不要尝试着把成功经验变为制度。成功涉及的因素有很多，同样的经历再做一次未必成功。 互联网，作为一个价值的创造者，它首先是一个毁灭者。 产品要对用户形成强烈的认知和感知，俗称口碑。 当产品获得海量用户后，它的边际成本将趋于0，然后通过广告或者服务的方式赚钱，就可以创造新的价值链。 任何商业模式的基础和核心都是产品 。 商业模式包括产品模式，用户模式，推广模式，收入模式。 如果你和用户的距离远了，那么你的价值就可能在价值链中被边缘化了。 网游的利润比毒品还高（看来感官带来的愉悦比不上“自我价值自我实现”带来的成就感） 小步快跑，快速迭代，快速反馈 有了互联网，很多传统的市场手段都会改变。例如把电影看做产品，电影要获得市场反馈，张艺谋的做法是经过放映，收集影评等六个标准的环节和流程。郭敬明的做法就是发一条微博，直接分析下面的上万条评论就可以大致知道哪些才是观众想看到的，便放在片尾作为彩蛋。无论是效率还是成本，后者都具有巨大的优势。 创新不只是发明，还包括商业模式上的创新和体验上的创新。 商业的本质就是让人性得到释放，最好能把用户的体验简单到极致。 利益受损者一定是不思进取，墨守成规的公司。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[好的领导力是一项综合素质，需要细心的规划、培养，以及常年不断的练习。优秀的管理者首先要学会做好内部营销。想成为一名好的管理者，团结众人，开创一番事业，先要把自己变成一名虔诚的布道者，心怀使命感，大声宣扬自己真正相信并珍视的价值，并付诸实践。 战略上从七个方面提升自己的领导力 要有愿景和关键要务金钱是不足以支撑一个人拼命的工作的，可能只能维持一段时间。愿景是激励大家向同一个方向前进的动力。 愿景如何制定呢？愿景不简简单单的针对公司，还要对社会，对客户。具体可以参考麦肯锡，具体执行管理层需要回答四个问题： 你为什么要来这家公司工作？ 你30年后如何告诉你的孙子你在这家公司工作三十年的原因？ 你希望公司十年后变成什么样子？ 这家公司有什么特色？ 关键要务是我们在一定期限内从所有想要完成的事情中挑选出3-6件最重要的事情去做，确保团队每个成员都清晰地知道，领导者要抓住每一个机会不停的去重复这个关键要务，当大家能把关键要务当成一个笑话讲的时候，目的已经达成了 时间管理时间管理最有效的书籍是－高效能人士的七个习惯，这本书里主要从四个象限讲就是重要紧急，重要不紧急，不重要紧急，不重要也不紧急 把所以需要做的事情分成四个象限，优先做重要紧急的事情，平常多做重要不紧急事情，这样重要紧急的事情才会变少，业务才会稳定推进 搞定－这本书讲述的是工作篮的概念，就是把你需要做的事情写出来放在篮子里，清空大脑，专注当下的事情。 反馈和接受反馈管理者要不断的给员工进行指导，对她们的工作能做出及时的反馈，管理者自身也需要得到反馈，可以在外边去找教练，得到别人的反馈，不断的提升自我。 现在好多人都听过kpi，但是kpi是一个末端环节，真正有效的是在工作中给与指导，让员工把事情做好，而不是做不好的时候进行惩罚。用kpi开人是因为领导觉得他本身也害怕这些比较艰难的谈话，所以一直就没有帮助下属成长。属离开的时候，会非常恨领导者为什么平常没有说什么。 领导者要学会授权授权让帮助别人不断的成长，让别人成为自己，自己才可以做其她更重要的事情。最简单的一种方式从一句话开始，嗯，abcde五件事，abc你自己来决定怎么做全权负责，cd向我汇报，我需要知道他的进度已经最后的效果。 领导者就是要学会拒绝团队成员，告诉他你很忙，让他自己处理。尤其男性不会拒绝，男人最喜欢的就是别人对他说需要，要，这样他就觉得显示出他自己的价值了 领导者要学会把脉团队领导者必须作为团队中最警惕的人，时刻发现团队中存在的问题，推动团队变革。领导者要如履薄冰，才能不断地改善团队。 其中最有效的做法就是组一个小分队，小分队由各个部门的接班人组成，问他们“如果新成立一家公司，我们应该怎么做？”，发现他们说的都是先有公司的问题，就能把现有团队中存在的问题充分的暴露出来。 管理者要成为团队的楷模要时刻谨记自己的身份，不管管理多大的团队，你都变成了大猩猩，也就是你本身的行为都会被放大，你迟到一次成员会觉得你经常迟到。所以要谨言慎行，以身作则 管理者要学会培养下属不断成长，比如说每个月都要挑选出两三个人，帮助他成长。别人也会向你学习，对其他的人员进行培训。管理者要信守承诺有担当不推卸责任，尤其是面对挫折的反应。 就是发挥潜能如果前面六点都做到了，我们领导者自然就能发挥自己的潜能。还有一个最重要的就是要有信心，即使你不知道怎么做的时候也要装作知道，给团队信心。 团队有了愿景选出关键要务，做好时间管理，保证关键要务顺利执行，在执行中不断作出反馈和接受反馈，学会授权，培育更多的人，审视团队中存在的问题，把脉团队，即时修正，成为团队的楷模，发挥潜能。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[《谁说商业直觉是天生的》这本书用很多商业案例和科学实验告诉我们，人类首先具有共情的能力，同时共情在商业上往往比商业简报更对战略更有指导意义。共情不仅会让你发现忽略的商机还能改变你看世界的方式。 具体的方法有：和客户零距离接触（直接访谈客户，给客户送礼品测试了解程度——每一个企业生产的产品就是一种礼物），换位思考，企业要忘掉自己的问题去积极地关注自己的顾客，关注个人体验，让员工参与经营（开卷管理法），企业文化情景设置为目标成客户的生活场景等。 总之，企业想要打造共情企业文化，有两种办法：一是让员工走出去，一种是把外部世界带进来。 这个是对商业数据化的一种挑战。当在职场无论是对上还是对下能够拿出数据及其分析结果，自然比说“我感觉我们这样做客户不会很舒服”更有说服力。因此，作者提出了共情之后的方法：共情也就是学会用别人的眼光看世界，这只是第一部分。更重要是共情后的，透过现象看本质，以及透过现象发现解决问题的办法，而不是和大家一样陷入惯性中。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[第一章：让使命、行动和结果协同起来 本书讲到协同力，协同力的作用是：让使命、行动和结果协同起来。 使命：决定了一家公司要抵达的终点，也就是我们想要到哪里去以及为什么去。 最好的使命陈诉既目标远大、鼓舞人心、又切合实际。也就是说，员工认同这个使命，决定它切实可行，它为员工描绘了美好的增长目标。并让员工投入巨大的工作热情。 行动：是指员工思考、探索、沟通和做事的方式。公司为了将使命和行动联系其他，公司领导层需要以非常公开、非常清晰、非常一致的方式告诉员工怎么做才能完成公司使命。 结果：是指为了确保整个过程能顺利推进，跟进员工是否认同使命、是否推动了使命的完成，决定是否让员工晋升和发放奖金。 领导层必须让员工明确知道，那些可以做，那些不可以做，那些做了会得到奖励。每一次人事变动比100次讲话要更有说服力。 提升协调力的过程中，完全可以把人事变动作为一种积极的激励手段，哪些人在落实使命的过程中行动力强，就提拔他。这样传递了强烈的信息给员工，对于整个公司也是非常大的鼓舞。此外，发放奖金也是另外一种鼓舞手段。 不管怎么说，一家成功的公司要建立一套完善的绩效考核和奖励制度。 第二章：用五张幻灯片制定战略 一些老式的制定战略的方法已经过时了，书中讲到了一种“五张幻灯片”方法来制定战略。 第一张：市场分析，评估竞争对手是谁，他们的市场份额多大，他们的优缺点是什么。 第二张：分析竞争对手最近的动向，从产品、技术和人员变动的角度去分析，其目的是预估未来他们的成长性和潜力。 第三张：分析本公司过去一年的状况。 第四张：需要分析的是潜在的变量，也就是风险点是什么。 第五张：分析公司优势，看看在一个存在大量竞争对手的市场上，本公司是否具有重大的、令人惊叹的、能出奇制胜的优势。让你改变和主导市场。 作者长期坚持一个理念：可以找到更加聪明、务实和快速的方法制定战略，只要你把合适的人放到合适的位置，事情就能顺利开展。 制定战略需要保持反映敏捷，需要经常反复对战略进行研究分析。 第三章：提升领导力的关键所在 作者认为领导力是使命、行动、结果协同起来的关键。他提出了领导力的几个关键素质。可以概括为4E+P：活力、鼓动性、执行力+决断力+激情。 领导者应该处理和下属的关系，包括： 要体谅下属，真正关心和知道如何调动他们的积极性。 要把自己视为“首席解释官”，让团队解释公司的使命和所需要的行动，做到上传下达，信息分享。同时要让员工知道工作的意义和价值所在。 要为下属扫除障碍，清楚官和僚主义和其他没有必要的条条框框。 要展示“慷慨基因”，下属取得的良好业绩之后，要慷慨地、公开地表扬和庆祝。 要确保下属快乐地工作，要创造一个轻松愉快的环境。 领导力的关键就是知道那些事能做，那些事不能做，必要要做两件事： 第一：搞清楚真实状况。公司的真实经营状况、面临的挑战、公司的战略等。 第二：在公司里建立信任感。在成功时为员工鼓掌，在低迷时为员工加油。 另外，还有一件事值得提出就是处理好离职员工。要表现出诚意和宽容，对每一名员工表达尊重。同时也要做好对表现不好员工的提前预警。要让他对自己公司的表现有预期。 第四章：建立一支卓越的团队建立一支有战斗力的团队，有几个方面：招聘、留住人才、考核制度。 关于招聘： 有两个关键点第一是避免招错人，第二是是注意员工的个性，不要让整个团队充满负能量。对于招错人的情况，应该尽快重新招聘。 另外招聘可以从“人”和“才”两个方面去下手，人的方面考虑应聘者的个人品质、诚信、自律等。才的方面主要看能力和行为方式。 关于留住人才：抽象点说，领导者要做的就是让下属有幸福感，让他们对公司的前途和自己的前途充满希望，让他们在工作中获得成就感。 关于考核制度：把员工分为三个等级，20%最有效，70%是有前景员工，10%是底层员工。并且每年至少要有两次面对面沟通的机会，并明确给出对员工的考评。让员工很清楚领导对自己的评价。并为自己的改善提供帮助。差异化的考核制度可以让员工更加有活力。 除了招聘、留住人才、考核制度，作者还提到一种人力资源管理的新模式。人力资源管理应该要和行政管理分开，人力资源管理应该是帮助领导者识别哪些员工在20%还是70%，并为这些员工制定培训方案，让他们不断成长。并为10%的员工打交道，帮他们找到新的工作和位置。要充分发挥人力资源的：发现、培养、激励和留住人才的功能。 第五章：做好个人职业生涯规划很多情况，我们都在犹豫是否该留住公司还是另谋出路。很多人没有对自己的职业规划做好功课，导致自己一直在彷徨中度过。 作者给出了一个解决方案。他引入了一个叫：“命运之域”的职业评价工具来帮助我们做出选择。 把你的生活想象成两条高速公路，一条公路代表你非常擅长的事，一条代表你真正喜欢的事。想象一下两条公路交叉的情形，你的兴趣和能力实现了交叉，这个交叉点就是你构建职业生涯最理想的地方。 这需要你最真诚地看待自己的能力、天分和价值。 看第一条公路，你最擅长的事，你要拿出足够的时间发掘自己的 特质或者潜能，看看自己究竟哪里与众不同。看第二条公路，找到你真正喜欢的事，你可能喜欢的很多，但需要把范围尽量缩小，找到真正喜欢的那几件事。 找到擅长和喜欢的事情后，看看哪些行业、公司和工作在交叉路口。答案就很明显了，找到自己的“命运之域”在哪里，你的成就感和幸福感关联起来，工作不再只是工作，反倒更像是一种生活方式。]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-11-16-Book-LifeInHanHanEyes%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[序 我所理解的生活就是除了造谣以外，去造其他一切东西。我心中的造化，就是创造了多少文化。 我所理解的生活就是做着自己喜欢的事情，养活自己，养活家人。 我所理解的生活就是和自己喜欢的一切在一起。 世间万千种宠爱，无数种人心，得之我幸，不得我也没什么不幸。我只认可一点，就是出门再匆匆，裤子拉链还是得拉好。——《我所理解的生活》 国事 除了利益和人与人之间的斗争，我们几乎对一切都冷漠。这种冷漠和荒诞所催生的新闻都被世界各地的报纸不停地放在头版，无奈地成了这个民族的注释。 我们所拥有的，他们都拥有过；我们所炫耀的，他们的纳税人不会答应；我们所失去的，他们都留下了；我们所缺少的，才是最能让人感到自豪的。 既然我们共享着太平洋的风，就让它吹过所有的一切。——《太平洋的风》 是，做人做事，如果没有了下限，可不什么都合格么？ 中国的老百姓和小龙虾很像，最能忍最能扛，在什么样的环境下都能生存，虽然有两只钳子，但常被人在背后捅刀，而且也夹不到对方。一有惊吓，第一反应就是往后退。 愿扛住了八级地震的人们，能扛住追打；也愿扛住了八级地震的政府大楼，能扛住追问。——《什邡的释放》 在一个国家走向完善和民主的道路上，我们站起来，走出去，坐下来，并不一定是为了那些空泛的大词，可能只为了一件事、一个人、一棵树、一家厂。也许事关自己，也许无关自己，就像什邡的污染再怎么也飘不到上海，但是我知道，我们每个人，终会遇到这一天，我们一样需要你的理解和支援，远方的朋友们。——《已来的主人翁》 钱都是辛苦赚的，实惠总是排在第一的。 在这个一点就着、一煽就旺的社会里，每个人的私有财产都是不安全的。 如果热血，没洒对地方就是变成鸡血；如果奉旨，演过了头就会变成千夫所指。 跳出棋盘的棋子，哪怕披着旗帜，最终也只是个弃子。——《跳出棋盘的棋子》 看见好的捧个场，遇见坏的冷个场，碰见傻的笑个场，等他们自己给自己砸个场，也只能这样。——《我和官员的故事》 是的，面对特权，我们厌恶，当享用到一点假特权，心中又窃喜；面对吃特供的人，我们批判，但自己用到了那些特供，又会得意。很多人恨特权，因为特权没有在自己手中。我朋友觉得如果他掌权，必须从善如流。其实未必这样。我相信没有人会不沉迷其中，除非他的特权大到无需彰显，只用来表演一些低调的姿态。 没有人能控制自己不会凌驾在他人和法律之上，哪怕他再好再温厚。体制赋予特殊个体的特权是无法靠自我修行来美化和消解的。 我们的社会进步或者退步，常常只是特权与特权之间的争斗结果。人有善恶，权无美丑，所以去向何方，全凭运气。 如果一个地方充满着不被限制的权力，那么谁都不会安全，包括掌权者自己。——《来，带你在长安街上调个头》 地表上的光鲜，地底下的不堪，正是我们周围很多东西的缩影。 城市里看得见的地方重要，看不见的地方更重要。城市让生活更美好，也能让生活更糟糕。——《暴雨行车指南》 文艺能不能复兴，其实也是人心的问题。如果人心没有复兴的话，那再多的基金、再多的口号，都没有用。有的时候，很多事情——我个人比较悲观——过了就是过了。 思想，别谈那么远吧。——《“文艺”没问题，“复兴”有问题》 世界上最成功最幸福的人，其实都有痛苦的一面，只是没有被大家发现而已。 不是每件事都能给人生带来什么，人生的时光，总需要去度过。我选择这样度过。——《答台湾记者问》 这是一个什么都可以说的地方，所以我就没什么可说的。 事实上所有的一切都是文化，八卦也有八卦的文化，电影有电影的文化。 事实上年轻人都是差不多的，而且我相信任何的媒体从业人员都有他的新闻理想、媒体追求的。而且未来这根线一定会越来越远，最终会彻底消失，因为所有的线都有可以承载的分量，如果它太重了，就一定会崩溃。 无论作家还是别的行业，首先你要确定自己是真的适合这个行业，而不仅仅是热爱。因为如果发现你热爱这个行业但是你并不适合他，其实是一种更大的痛苦。——《答香港读者问》 有些人的努力是为了摆脱自己原来的出身和环境，有些人的努力是为了证明无论出身和环境自己都可以，这都无可厚非。 对一辈子没搬过地方的老人来说，背井离乡的伤害会更大。 我迟早会回去，找一个河边的房子。虽然大家都走了。——《答亭林镇青年问》 天下势 我相信这些迟早会到来，只是希望它早些到来。 政治不是肮脏的，政治不是无趣的，政治不是危险的。危险的、无趣的、肮脏的政治都不是真正的政治。——《韩三篇》 从有了互联网开始，随着每个人的参与，曾经说出大家心里话的著名公知们被不停抛弃是一个必然的过程，抛弃一些人的名字不代表必须抛弃一个向善的名词。——《就要做个臭公知》 我们这一代人可以见证很多东西，我们今天所经历的一切，都是头皮屑。 一个不杀戮自己的人是危险的，哪怕被逼无奈戳了自己一下，也要报复。 由什么东西组成的，往往就是个什么东西。——《这一代人（2012版）》 家世 我想我懂你了，Leslie。这眼前的世界并不是你我想象的那样。你改变不了。我也改变不了。 你说你一生没做坏事，为何这样。我想我可以试着告诉你为何。因为，你一生没做坏事，所以，就是这样。——《偶像：写给张国荣》 命里有时终须有，命里无时须强求。因为命里本来什么都没有，只有诞生和死亡，而中间的都是你要强求的部分。缘分不是走在街上非要撞见，缘分就是睡前醒后彼此想念。 世上唯有爱情，唯有想在一起的两个人。两个想在一起的人，便是最大，便是最正，他人皆是第三者。——《命里有时终须有，命里无时须强求》 牢骚也是推动社会进步的一种方式。 活在这个世界上就是在消费这个社会，就看你是向善的还是向恶的。——《我不讨好任何人》 没有人永远和过去的自己一致，除非你不再成长。 人的性格未必只有一面，也未必需要符合其他人的设定。每个人的境遇和脾性都是不同的。你不能拿着标尺先裁量自己，再去宣判每个与你尺码不同的他人是伪劣产品。 红灯永远不能照亮你的前程，照亮你前程的，是你的才能。 人，可以不上学，但一定不能停止学习。 只有阅读，才会进步。 我相信造物者一定赋予了每一个人特殊的才能，只是很多人没有发现而已。 每一个人，纵然缺点一身，但必然有一些地方是长于他人的，那是你区别于他人的标记，也是造物者公平的地方，就看你能否找到这些标记。 没有人能让所有人满意，所以让自己和你中意的人满意就可以了。你所判定的一切，也许就是你自己内心的投影。人生就是一个不断接纳和抛弃的过程，就是一段迎接冷眼嘲笑孤独前行的旅途。KO不了你的，也许更让你OK；没然你倒下的看，也许让你更强大。我也将尽我所能，为在乎我的人创造各种东西，绝不向厌恶我的人解释这是个什么东西。——《写给每一个自己》 过去式 如果文明不够文明，那就让野蛮足够野蛮。 电影只要关注现实，就不会太烂。但关注现实的电影也因为容易审查的原因妥协或者被修改得面目全非，哎，你们想怎样。 排场无关格局，气派不是气势。 Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss. . . But every once in a while you find someone who’s iridescent,and when you do,nothing will ever compare. 有人住高楼，有人在深沟，有人光万丈，有人一身锈，世人万千种，浮云莫去求，私人若彩虹，遇上方知有。为热爱的人或事物洒下热血和热泪，最坏的结果无非就是对方一句“你想怎样”。——《操，你想怎样》 博客虽然在传播性上差很多，但安安静静，如同家园。打开之时，音乐传来，那种熟悉就好似打开家门，黑暗中就能顺手开灯。 这一点我一直比较传统，相信文章比段落更有力量。 关注这事情就好比少年交友，有了好的关注，生活更加丰富；有了错的关注，哈士奇和狼都分不清楚。——《微博》 我很小的时候，我一直以为，备忘录的意思就是把事情都记在一本本子上，然后准备忘记。不过……难道不是这样的吗。 有的时候死死的坚持可能会在一个合适的时候重拾，无论对理想或者对感情都是这样。当然，这完全因人因事而各异，并不那么通用，纯属个人机遇。 我是一个最恨束缚的人，也是一个晚上开车看见路上有一个坑都会报警并守着这个坑的人。 悲悯都抵不过悲剧的重复。 一个好的写作者在杀戮权贵的时候，也应该杀戮群众。 我不希望成为一些别的什么，而一切和我的工作有关的自由，我会依照宪法，不停地要，躺着、坐着、站着、走着、写着、说着，我只有不停的要，要到你想逃。无推动，无变革。 至于写作，在新年里，我希望我能写的只让我自己更喜闻乐见，不再讨好除了我女儿以外的任何人，想写的写，不想写的就一个省略号。——《我的2011》 如果说我的文章影响了读者的口味，还不如说是有一样口味的读者找到了我。 我越来越觉得很多东西的结果，其实并不是不同人的改变，而只是同类人的聚集。 你所关注的一切，就是你所看到的世界。而这个世界更新得越来越快，你都来不及下载。——《这事儿都过气了》 每个人的道路都不同，我走在我的野路上，她走在她的大路上，都值得祝福。只要不走歪路邪路，每条道路都有成功的方式。 我爱的人们在哪里，哪里就是我的所在。——《一个流传多年的谣言》 炒作和冒着一定的风险发表观点是有很大区别的，也是非常好分辨的。只可惜，大家似乎都分辨不了。 在这个国家，做一个忧国忧民的人是最傻和最痛苦的，国家不乐意，国民不在意。我不要做那样的人，我只希望自己六十岁时是个被年轻姑娘喜欢的深沉的老顽童。 我认为一个更良好的社会应该有更多的知识分子，越来越多的知识分子。只有知识分子很多的时候，这个国家才会更向前，更进步。而意见领袖如果多的话，其实不见得是一件多么好的事情。 家庭幸福，哪怕事业刚刚起步，不是很顺利，这些其实都是立。你的内心很快乐，就是立了。——《我造就了我自己》 我是 人啊，在青春期总是不承认自己有任何偶像，却忘记年幼时他们给你的力量。 每个人的身体，都有厚的地方，它们各有不同，有些人厚的是手上的老茧，有些人厚的是背上的污垢，有些人厚的是脸上的老皮，我愿自己厚的是心脏的肌肉。打死也不能放弃，穷死也不能叹气，要让笑话你的人成为笑话。 他人笑你，是正常的，无论是主观还是客观，你当时都没有做好、没有做到，你有什么资格豁免被他人嘲笑？你的哭泣，你的遭遇，和别人的困苦相比，有什么不同之处么？每个人都想召唤上帝，每个人都觉得自己快要过不去。他人鼓励你，那是你助燃的汽油；他人笑话你，也许是你汽油里的添加剂。 做事是你的原则，碎嘴是他人的权利，历史只会记得你的作品和荣誉，而不会留下一事无成者的闲言碎语。——《春萍，我做到了》 搞文化，哪里都能搞，只要你有一颗想做事情的心，在哪里都一样。 旅行不重要，你所热爱的是最重要的。你的青春就是一场远行，一场离自己的童年、自己的少年越来越远的远行。你会发现这个世界跟你想象的一点都不一样，你甚至会觉得孤独，你会受到很多排挤。度假和旅行，其实都解决不了这些问题。 远行不重要，去哪里不重要，找到自己所热爱的才重要。千万不要放弃，千万不要怕被他人嘲笑。因为无论你做什么，总会有一些人在后面笑你，你做得好，你做得坏，都会有人笑你。不要怕被人嘲笑，哪怕你立志要做第一个华人美国总统，不要紧，just do it。——《青春就是一场远行》 如果有一天，我终于拿到了一个中意的总冠军以后，一定会很高兴地向大家宣布，其实我是一个作家。——《其实我是一个作家》 既然全天下的一楼都送给百度了，真诚希望百度能更上一层楼。——《维权》 记着也好，忘掉也罢，有一个一直都在的人或事物，总是好的。——《碎片》 我发现，我们所谓的批判，我们自以为是的“启蒙”， 我们所宣扬的那些，其实大部分都是重复传播。现在的环境就是这样，一群知道了1+1=2的人不停地向另外一大群早就知道1+1=2的人反复传播1+1=2。不少热闹多是虚妄。重复传播累积到了一定的时间就会引起逆反，无论你说得有多么正确。中国人有时候不在乎对错是非，他们在乎谁能让他们心里更舒坦。 当你知道了大众心态就是“存在即合理，但如果你存在得比我好即不合理”，你也许就知道最终能留下些什么了。 你所关注的一切就是你所看见的世界。 以前的我很蠢，老想着去改变一些什么，其实什么都不会被改变，只是不同时间有不同的显现而已，一切早就存在好了，存在好的是无法改变的，但让什么存在是能去努力的。 对社会名人自媒体的高看其实就是人有了一点名气和号召力以后对自我的认识产生了偏差，谁都别以为自己是个人物。所谓号召力都是空的，说话顺耳就叫号召力，哪天逆耳了就弄死你，这就是自媒体的下场。举凡个体，都是容易被搞的，举凡个体，也有受众的局限。 自媒体的意义在于每一个个体的自由，在于可以随意选择自己爱看的媒体，而不是一群大V的拥粉自重，包括我在内。 文化作品必须有很重的个人文化烙印，但文化产品只有去个人化才能走得更远。 世界上那么多纷纷扰扰，能真正和你产生关系的不多，外面世界那么冷，要记住那个帮你暖被窝的。 ——《让大家扫兴了》 所谓深刻就是深深刻在你身上，扎一刀，喊一句，再扎一刀，再喊一句，多扎几刀，拧一下，就安静了。——《东望洋》 乐趣是一切的推动力。 我觉得有一天没人关心我了，这个世界肯定更加美好。 中国人往往活着活着就活不明白了，所以他们在死前，随时有自我践踏的可能。——《我最终想要的是一个和谐的人生》 代跋 每个人都是自己的神，爱你者的神，你所支配的世界里的神。行善不作恶，创造不伐异，即为神。那些享有绝对权力而作恶者，是妖是魔，不是神。被神化者更非神。用各种借口砸神者，往往要塑魔。 神不保佑你，因为神就是你所理解的你自己。——《写作三种，神凡两忘》]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[从长远来看，占上风的是那些练习更勤奋的人，而不是那些一开始在智商或者其他才华方面稍有优势的人。练习是决定某人在某个特定领域或行业中最终成就的唯一最重要因素，如果基因在其中发挥作用，那么，他们的作用会慢慢消失。 四个特点： 第一，有目的的练习具有定义明确的特定目标。定义明确的目标，分解成具体的小目标，根据小目标制定具体的计划，可以有效地引导练习。 第二，有目的的练习是专注的。要想取得进步，必须完全把注意力集中在你的任务上。 第三，有目的的练习包含反馈。适时的反馈可以让我们来辨别在努力做得事情哪些方面还有不足，以及怎么会存在这些不足，以便对应的练习来提高自己。 第四，有目的的练习需要走出舒适区。要持续不断地尝试那些刚好超出当前能力范围的事情，因此，它需要人们付出近乎最大限度的努力。也许是有目的练习最为重要的一个组成部分。如果你从来不迫使自己走出舒适区，便永远无法进步。人类的身体有一种偏爱稳定性的倾向。大脑对于处在舒适区之外却离得并不太远的“甜蜜点”上的挑战，改变最为迅速。练习改变大脑结构，潜能可以被构筑。 书中提到的三个关键练习因素：专注、反馈、纠正 制定自己的目标（成为一名优秀的作家） 找到一个老师或是模仿对象（《观察者》杂志的作者们） 勤加练习（先练习词汇、再练习结构、逻辑） 不断反馈修正改进（对照自己的文章和杂志中文章的差别） 设立练习的标准(直到自己写了他人喜爱的作品)]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-11-01-Book-EnchantedObjects%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[讲述未来产品四大趋势，人类基本心理六大推动力，打造神器的五大步骤。 魅力产品的六大推动力 1.全知，我们想要了解更多的知识，想要知道除了事实和信息以外还有什么，我们还希望预测今后将会发生什么。之前，人类不知道时间、方向和天气情况，后来有了日晷和钟表就可以标记时间，天体观测仪和罗盘可以识别方向，温度计和气压计就可以预测天气。这对于当时的人类都是魅力产品。魅力产品即使做不到全知，但它可以让我们看到过去一直忽视或者被隐藏的现象~ 2.传心，人们都是希望通过某个手段了解别人的心思，了解周围的人在想什么，将要发生什么以及其他人的看法。现有设计中很多都围绕传心术迈进。不管是机械监听还是望远镜，更甚至无线电技术等~同样社交领域的发展，从文字——图片——视频，以及社交传播和阅读等情况可以产生海量信息，那么现在问题不再是如何获得信息，而是互利的良性传心术——更好的理解与我们相关和对我们产生影响的思想和情感~ 3.求安，远离危险是人类的本能，比如解药，房屋、冷兵器等，都是为了抵御病毒，自然灾害和野兽的伤害。现在如今的摄像头也是为了保护，不过是在损失了隐私的条件下~。安全的问题，可以看看现在锁盾的产品，一个通过无线连接的设备，可以知道门锁上没，而且可以远程开门，可以避免带钥匙以及是否忘记关门的烦恼~ 4.长生，人类像祖先一样希望长生，先如今寄希望于药物、手术和饮食方案。而且现在人们喜欢被量化的自我，包括小米手环、苹果手表（健康）、云麦的体脂体重称和fitbit运动感应灯。大家可以着手设计下提醒病人按时吃药的闪光帽和对应app，食物手机（获取食物的热量、碳水化合物比例、蛋白质和脂肪含量），幸福叉子（提醒你吃饭速度、用叉次数和间隔时长），食盐哨兵（和朋友社交沟通、微型投影机投影分析）。 5.高效运输，现如今人们在乎到了什么地方的同时更在意我们如何到哪里~，从公共汽车到的士再到uber的共享私家车以及谷歌正在研发的无人驾驶技术，使得汽车更像一种服务而非财产。说到汽车同时，找车位也是一个痛点，所以，现在国内有很多找车位的app，虽然体验很差，但是照样一堆人使用。 6.表达，创造力不仅仅是情感宣泄还有精通技术来表达，所以人类才学习和钻研技术来表达自己~也有很多魅力产品是帮助人们进行表达的，比如《节奏大师》把人们熟悉的钢琴转换为操作按钮，然后弹奏出大师的音乐~ 胡适先生曾有云；“大胆的想象，小心的求证。”小心的求证可以通过前仆后继地奋斗以及坚持不懈的努力得到，而大胆的想象却很难获得，一个好点子的提出往往会改变一个时代。如；法拉第的磁生电，牛顿的万有引力，微积分的发明……这都是在人类历史上举足轻重的发明或者创造。正如《解忧杂货店》里的时空发生了扭转，19世纪70年代的咨询信传到了20世纪的今天，当回信上写着手机，电脑等我们日常生活中习以为常的事物时，那时候的日本人根本听都没听过，也不会想到世界在经过短短几十年就发生了这么翻天覆地的变化。 戴维罗斯，麻省理工学院媒体实验室教授，知名智能硬件公司Vitality联合创始人兼CEO。多年来专注于智能硬件的研发，使他很清晰地了解到用户的需求和痛点，并且很快的就能将一件平淡无奇的产品变成一件魅力产品。下面，让我们一起进入魅力产品的世界吧。 科技在不断的进步与发展，我们也能感觉到，科技含量越高的产品在感官上往往也会变得更轻，更小，功能更齐全。那么，魅力产品的发展趋势是什么呢？四个极致—-终端世界、可穿戴设备、人工智能、魅力产品。终端世界就是许多功能浓缩在一件产品上，很显然，手机已经实现了这种功能，但这还远远不够；可穿戴设备目前杰出的代表是虚拟眼镜，但目前也只有观感得以实现了，而且效果并不是很好，长时间带着头疼；人工智能在前段时间可是出尽风头啊，赢得了世界围棋冠军，但目前的人工智能也只局限在某一种特定功能上；魅力产品即将普通的产品变成一个全方位功能的产品，如；一支笔，本来只有写字功能，但做成魅力产品后写字只是最基本的功能，还能录音，导航，照相……在这四个设计趋势下，作者把现有的产品发展空间给无限的扩大，（在现在看来是无限扩大，说不定将来的某一天看来这只是人类一小步也说不一定。）而作者自身也在研发渴望将来某一天能够实现。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[在创造整合式生活练习时我们问过一些关键问题： 古代传统中最有效和最关键的练习是什么？ - 这本书中贯穿各种身心的练习，从历史上人们对练习的实践总结开始 最近有哪些关于练习的新启发？ -读书的习惯倒是没落下，最近新增了晚上跑步1小时（尽管不那么热了，但是户外跑并未恢复），挺喜欢喜悦曼陀罗冥想，不过暂停有一个月了，好久没这么忙过。。 我们怎样找到一套方法，来联结最多样的洞见和教学法？ 每次只专注养成一个习惯，每月只坚持一个习惯的养成，循序渐进 我们怎样利用这些知识来促成一生的成长和觉醒？ 去爱是最好的选择，以爱促进自我和他人的心智成熟，所不断坚持的自我完善的意愿 如果你观察进化的过程，就能发现，不断积累起来的无数细微变化不时地产生着新的特征，并形成全新的事物（比如，从原始的化学混合物中生成的活细胞，或者，早期人类最早创造出来的艺术）。这标志着发展的新阶段、层次或波在四个象限中同时发生：物理和生理的进化（它）、社会经济的发展（它们）、文化的发展（我们）和个体意识的发展（我）。这些阶段是以可辨别的形式呈现出来的。 身体层面的练习：有氧有在坚持，瑜伽、健身个人不是很喜欢，主要是懒得去健身房（尽管也办卡了）。 心智层面的练习：读书方面有几个习惯，1.上下班等零散时间听喜马拉雅，大约每天2小时，2.空闲的时候写些笔记，或看看别人的笔记, 3.重复的看一些经典 心灵层面的练习：冥想做过两种，一种是正念冥想，还有一种是喜悦曼陀罗 一些摘要：整合式交叉训练的协同作用：一个领域的成功能加快其他领域的发展：同时练习冥想和举重的人，在冥想上进步更快 潜意识与显意识（顺便推荐：思考，快与慢） - 阴影模块主要影响内在的心理机制，意识到并且承认自己的阴影，就能将更多的亲密和诚实带入人际关系中，释放身体内压抑的能量，使工作更为清晰而有效率，提高付出真诚和道德行动的能力，甚至能改善你的财务。 你意识到什么——认知； 我需要什么——需要； 我是谁——自我认同； 什么对我很重要——价值； 我对此感受如何——情商； 我觉得生命是美丽——审美； 什么是正确的事情——道德发展； 我们应该怎样交流——人际发展； 身体怎么做——运动能力； 我的终极关怀是什么？——灵性； 身心主要中心：头部、心脏和丹田丹田是天然的肉体功能——直觉、生命力和能力的中心心脏是感受能力和灵性直觉的中心，也是爱与关注自我和他人能力的中心意识之光通过头部由中心向外照射，让我们有能力看穿幻象，从而从有限或固执的观点中解脱出来。整合灵性深刻进入第一人称的觉醒，同时深化第三人称的冥想也恢复了同第二人称的交流。 观照第三人称的灵性：宇宙观照 物理世界中也能找到灵性。灵修团体仍在灵修中起着重要作用，礼拜或者修习团体可以增加练习的丰富程度和参与的投入程度，团体也能帮助你更注意到你的变化，团体分享的经验比单独的经验更影响你的成长。 第一人称冥想（静坐）——真我、觉察、存在、心境。 第二人称神交（祈祷）——您、所爱者、我的至爱、耶稣、安拉、阿弥陀佛、玛利亚等。 第三人称关照（自然）——灵性、宇宙、实相、此在、充满、进化等。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[国庆旅途路上看完了这本书，书里面讲了很多不错的方法，记录下来以后再捉摸： Page 2, 《一胜九败》，作者：优衣库创办人柳井正。“23条经营理念”。 备注：爱迪生说，我尝试了1999次不能制成电灯泡的方法，在第2000次试验的时候终于制成了。在某种程度上讲，对于那些gone forever的事，便放下罢。对于那些没有达成目标的事，说明仍需努力。就比如，我还在努力把自己打包出去，还在尝试各种可以让自己为兴趣工作的方法。 Page 5, 心近，天涯咫尺；心远，咫尺天涯。 Page 20: 写邮件时，先放附件，再写邮件，把顺序调整过来就不会漏了。 Page 39: 德国护手霜“小甘菊”。纪录片《德国工艺》 《NHK纪录片 日本企业长盛不衰的奥秘》 Page 43: 有时候，负责任比拿薪水更重要，更有价值。 Page 46: 尝试用自己的语言进行表达。这样的学习和理解过程形象地总结为：贩卖一遍。 Page 49: 企业能做多大，就看企业家的格局有多大，而企业家的格局有多大，则要看他的心胸有多宽广，气度有多大。 Page 59: 《20：敏感是训练出来的》 Page 61: 大数当然只是用于方向和趋势的判断。仅仅记住大数是不够的，还要记住每个项目的关键指标。关键指标，是很多数字赖以存在的基础和基点。例如：计划部门，必须记住物料采购周期、产品生产周期、按时交货单、每个工序标准加工时间等等，依此为参考点，任何与之相关的数字拿来一比，便可以立即判断进度是否异常；若考核业绩的话，一定要记得部门平均业绩，个人平均业绩，最高、最低业绩等；如果是市场部，除了记住一个月的销售指标外，自然要分解到每天，每个片区的销售业绩指标，被问起时，只要看当天业绩和累积大数，自然对销售状况了然于胸了。 就几句话：“记大数，略小数，有事没事，琢磨琢磨关键指标，盯紧异常数。” Page 65: 行迹管理法。 认识学习过程分三个层次：第一，初学习，单、多点提取知识点；第二，运用新知识，将其与已有知识架构相连接，理解加深，应用面拓宽；第三，新旧知识融合，重组成新架构，产生新知识（或创新）。 Page 66: 元规则的定义。参考《血酬定律》作者吴思。 Page 70: 80/20 原则。 Page 72: 公司员工的管理和培训，千万不能因为订单少或者工作量而有所放松，反而要在没事可做的时候，要更加注重对员工的管理和培训。 Page 77: 原则上，所有的命令都听直属上司的。如果出现紧急情况下的越级指挥，要接受。但接受命令的人，需要向自己的直属上司汇报。原则上，越级发布了命令的上司，也应该向下属知会和说明。兄弟部门要求和需求，根据自己的判断进行处理和协调。兄弟部门商机的命令和要求，根据自己本职岗位和职责进行判断，如果是属于自己职责范围内的事，则要取得自己直属上司的同意。如果是协助性的工作，则可以根据自己的实际情况进行判断，给予协助，如有必要，可将协助工作的内容和项目的进度及结果，抄送给自己的上司。 Page 86： 实际上，产品在生产中是由两个流构成的，一个叫实物流，一个叫信息流。 Page 92: 但我觉得值得。那些比你年轻的毛孩们，跟你一起工作，会让你真切感受到清楚和活力。想一想，还有什么事比有一天他见到你，忽然跟你聊起还记得你当初对他的鼓励、批评或者帮助，他因此怎么思考和成长，更能让你幸福和满足？ Page 100: 在制造业哩，有一种技术叫SPC （全称Statistical Process Control，统计制程管制）。他用非常科学的方法，实时监控生产过程中产品质量的随记波动与异常波动，对生产过程的异常趋势提出预警。 Page 118: 《038：逻辑思考的力量》 《金字塔原理：思考、表达和解决问题的逻辑》 比如，写东西，要先从结论写起，而后向下分解，写次要的东西，再向下分解，写更详细的过程。 Page 122: 我将所有文件分类存放，并给每个文件夹编了号，便于记忆；每个文件存储时，都有完整清晰的标题，而且要在后面缀上存储日期，这样便于搜索查询。由此及彼，往后我写邮件会注意标题完整清晰，一看就明白内容讲什么，这样便于收件人和自己检索；别人发给我的邮件，我处理和回应严格执行不过夜的原则，防止拖延和浪费原则；我发文件给别人回签，会在上面附一张表，清晰写上需要对方关注的重点和回签的日期。有些邮件，你要改天回复，所以要回给他你下次给出意见的时间。 Page 136, 有内在逻辑，能说明问题的数字，才具有意义。作为管理人员，一定要充分了解对方想了解什么，能切中对方的思路来整理数字，表达图表，否则，即为不合格。作为听众，需要的是清晰明了的结构和逻辑清晰、主次明确、层次分明的分析及论据。 Page 149: 我们活着来到这个世界，就没打算活着回去。所以，在这有限的时间里，我们应该珍惜生命，珍惜机会，更要珍惜那得之不易的时间。 Page 165: 《051: 与懒惰拔河》中懒人和死神的对话很经典。 Page 171: 但一些隐性的东西，如德鲁克所说的对其他员工负有管理责任的人员，即使他回到家里，隐形的责任也支配着他，使其随时处于待命状态。 Page 192: 一个人真正的价值，体现于他异于常人和常规的思维模式和思考能力，而不是他傲慢的态度。一个希望自己走的更远，能发挥更大价值的人，应该学会谦逊做人，弘扬做事。这才叫桀骜不驯！ Page 197: PCB: Printed Circuit Board，印制电路板。梁志立。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[从报表看企业 数字背后的秘密 张新民]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-10-16-Book-ReadReport4Company%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[财务知识学习，财务报表说明的是过去的企业，财务用报表描述了一个企业的经营状况。现金流量表是对资产负债表中货币资金变化情况的展开说明，利润表是对资产负债表中股东权益未分配利润、盈余公积和资本公积项目部分内容的展开说明。 一、基础分析 观察资产总规模及其变化。先看看企业的大势，是稳定发展、持续扩张，还是持续萎缩。 观察资产总规模中揭示的盈利模式信息：经营资产与投资资产各占多少比重？尤其要注意通过合并报表找到母公司向子公司提供的所有资源——找到控制性投资的规模。 观察主要资产规模的变化及其方向性含义。从流动资产、投资资产到固定资产和无形资产，逐一考察，找出变化的状况及其对盈利的影响。 重点观察主要不良资产区域。这里所说的不良，是指不能按照预期利用、不能发挥应有效用。主要的不良资产包括闲置的固定资产、包含潜亏因素的投资、周转缓慢的存货和债权，等等。 观察流动资产对流动负债的保障。不需要计算流动比率。流动资产和流动负债问题的实质是经营中的上下游关系管理问题和短期融资安排以及集团资金管理问题。要观察企业是否有“两头吃”的能力，这关系到判断企业的核心利润能否产生足够的现金流量。 观察企业负债融资发展的潜力，也就是企业资产对总负债的保障程度。除了看负债率外，银行还通过看“三品”（人品、产品、押品）来决定是否向企业发放贷款。这表明，决定企业融资能力的重要因素不是负债率，而是企业的盈利能力、利润带来现金的能力、企业对贷款是否有其他保障措施等。 二、对企业发展前景的预测从企业的经营活动看前景经营资产：包括货币资金、商业债权、存货、固定资产和无形资产。 对于债权，看其回收状况；对于存货，主要看其规模、结构、周转、毛利率等； 对于固定资产，可以从规模、结构周转等方面进行分析。综合来看，经营资产对应着核心利润，核心利润对应着经营净现金。要使企业步入良性发展的轨道，就应该不断优化经营资产的结构、减少不良资产占用、及时处置闲置资产、适量增加经营资产的规模、改善经营资产的结构，通过经营资产的合理利用来提高企业产品的市场竞争力和盈利能力，也可进行适当的经营资产置换，增强与其他资产组合后的增值潜力等。 从企业的投资活动看前景 重点关注控制性投资企业的控制性投资就是被投资者的经营资产。而被投资者的经营资产总规模基本上可以从合并报表与公司数之差中大概看出一些端倪。要使企业步入良性发展的轨道，就应该不断优化投资性资产的结构，及时处置盈利能力较弱的投资性资产，以改善其结构等。 从融资、重组、并购等手段看前景企业通过融资、重组、并购等手段来加快发展有几种途径： 增量贷款。这是盈利能力比较强的企业发展的首选融资方式。 债转股。债转股有两种情况，一种情况是企业资不抵债，要进行债务重组；另一种情况是以前发行了可转债，在一定条件下可以实行债转股。 股东增量入资。这是通过股东入现金或非现金（土地使用权、其他公司的股权等）方式支持企业的发展。 控制权变更、核心人力资源变动等。 资产置换。不同行业的盈利能力是不一样的，通过资产置换可以达到提高资产盈利能力的目的。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[细节：如何轻松影响他人 - 罗伯特·西奥迪尼]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-09-07-Book-HowToInfluenceOthers%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[为便于查阅，拷贝辑录52个细节要点作为参考纲要，等需要深入了解时再进行扩展阅读。 1.向“大众”借力 人类的行为会在相当程度上受到周围的人的影响，尤其是那些令他们深深认同的人，这就是“社会认同原理”，也就是从众心理，如果在物业费缴费通知单上标出大多数人都已经按时缴纳完毕，那么拖欠物业费的现象会有相当大程度的改善。 2.“小众”的反作用力 人们总是愿意与自己所属的群体行为保持一致，同时与不愿与之扯上关系的群体划清界限。比如当年黄渤在《疯狂的石头》里一句台词“班尼路，牌子”毁掉了班尼路积攒多年的品牌价值。因而，如果不鼓励某种行为，就把这些行为和受众们不想要的身份联系起来。 3.非常态VS常态 每个人心中的社会规范标准是不一样的，用违背对方的社会规范角度去规劝，更容易获得说服效果。比如，你若有个朋友总是不结婚，你要劝劝他：如果对方也认为“结婚”是很必要的，那么要强调不结婚的坏处；如果对方认为“结婚”没那么大的必要，那么就要强调“结婚”能够带来的好处。 4.强大的环境暗示 “破窗理论”是指微小地违背社会规范行为，会对其他行为造成负面的影响。环境中的不良现象如果被放任存在，会诱使人们仿效，甚至变本加厉。改变环境比改变人的想法更容易，所以应对之道是让人们清楚地看到别人在遵守规则。比如在一个单位里，如果多数人桌面是乱的，原来爱干净的人的桌面也容易变得凌乱。如果多数人桌面整洁，原来不太爱干净的人的桌面也会变得更为整洁。环境整洁了，整体工作效率会相应提升。 5.改个名字，改变一切 我们非常重视自己的名字，即便是再嘈杂的环境中，只要有人提到自己的名字，注意力立马就会被吸引过去。在心理学领域叫“鸡尾酒会现象”。所以在和人沟通的时候，清楚而多次地提到对方的名字会让对方更重视，这也是为什么群发祝福短信大家都很讨厌，而点名祝福的短信，再短也会受到欢迎。 6.如何化敌为友 当你希望鼓励大家联手合作的时候，应该把重点放到大家共同的身份上，找到共同点。比如球迷多数都支持自己省份的球队，有时吵得不可开交，但当踢面对国际赛事时，因为同是中国人的共同身份，却都同仇敌忾一致对外。 7.预测他人的喜好、渴望与需求 我们总是高估对某一个人的了解程度，因为一方面对方的喜好随时间在变化，另一方面由于关系固定，导致不再用心挖掘对方的喜好。所以不管是老朋友还是老客户，都别用老眼光去看一个人，有必要不定期安排一些非正式沟通机会，促进彼此的了解。 8.主动承诺的力量 承诺和一致性原理——人们更愿意去履行自己许下的诺言。给团队分配任务的时候，让成员复述一下自己的工作内容，会使任务得到更好的执行；活动邀请信息中让对方回复“好的”、“收到”会使活动出席率更高。 9.承诺要行动，要公开 公开许下某项具体承诺的人更有可能去行动，可以做提示牌、徽章之类的提示物，来提醒他们做出的承诺。在工作中可以把阶段性的工作目标公布出来，对推进工作进程效果更好。 10.“心安理得”效应 采取了一个积极行为之后，人会心安理得地松懈下来，不再采取新的积极行动。比如有些朋友气喘吁吁跑了五公里之后，奖励自己一顿啤酒烧烤，导致白跑了。比如有些人昨晚加班了第二天感觉迟到好像不那么严重。“心安理得”效应是应该想办法避免的。 11.如何为员工鼓劲儿加油 “多劳多得”这样的物质激励有效，但是一方面效果不持久，另一方面成本高。多提工作的意义与重要性，谈工作的使命与愿景，对提高员工的工作意愿有显著的效果。在物质激励与精神激励之间要找到一个平衡点，既能保证公平，又能保证团队的效能。 12.如何避开决策陷阱 逐步升级的承诺，会导致投入成本高于收益，导致错误的决策与糟糕的后果，一定要避免。拍卖时，很多竞拍的人因为“逐步升级的承诺”而拍出可怕的高价。这是因为如果人们做出一个承诺，他们可能迫于内心和外部压力，持续做出和承诺相一致的行为，并逐步升级、超过承受能力。解决方案：拍卖时，让一个人做决策，另一个人现场执行。 13.巧用“执行意向” 明确的执行计划更有助于行动，不仅对自己，对对方也同样适用。在说服别人行动时，想办法明确关于此事对方的下一步计划，有助于目标的达成。 14.推迟一点儿会更好 如果你希望别人马上改变某个行为，而你确信会遭到拒绝，那么你就换个方式，让对方答应在未来某个时段做出改变。对于要改变下属的不好行为，最好别要求马上做出改变，给出一段过渡时间效果会更好。 15.为了将来的自己 如果触动了人们对“将来的自己”的道德责任感，就可以说服他们去做一些长远上对他们有益的事情。比如告诉人们，要“为60岁退休的你负责”，就能增加他们的储蓄率。还有学习、健身、读书等。 16.目标设得好，干劲儿会更足 把目标中具体的数字变换成浮动性的数字，会更有利于目标达成。 17.损失规避原则 说服对方时，不要只提出一个选项，让对方“接受或拒绝”，而是要提出两个选项，让对方去选择。与此同时，指出如果不这样选的话，他们会失去什么。 18.如何克服拖延症 截止日期越短越能促进人行动，太长则会拖延。安排任务切忌给太长时限，反而更容易延误。 19.如何留住顾客跟定你 如何让排队效率更高？等下去。所以在顾客排队的时候，给他们一些事情做，能让顾客更有耐心。比如海底捞在等餐的时候可以玩棋、吃零食、做美甲、擦鞋等等 20.把潜力变成现实 当你想说服客户买你公司的产品，或者面试的时候想要说服对方聘用你时，要先强调你的产品，或者你自己的潜力，然后再说做出过哪些成绩，而不是反过来。先强调潜力能更好地吸引对方的兴趣，然后才有机会展示过去的成绩。 21.把会议开得更高效 会前收集每个人的发言或提问信息，组织会议的人最后发言，提前做好任务清单，安排好座位座次，尽量用桌签指定座位。如果会议的目的是创造合作互助的气氛，那圆桌更好，因为圆桌强调的信息是整体目标和共同利益。如果领导希望团队成员各尽其责，那正方形或长方形桌子更好，因为带角的形状和有主有次的座次安排激发了人们对独特性的追求。 22.服装的影响力 与对方会面，衣着太随意不好，太正式也不好，标准答案是比对方稍微正式一点点。 23.亮出专家身份 强调专业能力能显著提高沟通效果，当然，前提是你真的很专业。 24.不确定的说服力 用斩钉截铁的语气想要去说服人容易被对方误认为骗子或托，语气中带有某种程度的不确定的专家，反而更容易说服人。 25.中心位置的影响力 展架上中间位置的货更抢手，人群中中间位置的人显得更权威。 26.如何激发创意 会议的场地选在天花板较高的房间更有利于激发创意，选在天花板较低的房间更有利于解决具体方案和行动计划。 27.主场还是客场 环境设置影响行为，就像NBA往往会有“主场优势”，所以一般大型的会谈、谈判会选在“中立”的地点，比如某酒店的会议厅。 28.如何让自己变得更强大 心理暗示的力量，回忆并写下曾经让自己感觉到强大、有力的时刻，比如某个成就事件，会真的让自己更加强大有力，有自信。开始谈判或面试前几分钟，回忆自己的巅峰时刻，刻意保持开放的身体姿势，会让你体内的力量激素明显上升，你会更自信。 29.你所需的只是爱 只要有“爱”的象征、线索，比如心形的图案，就能激发人们的爱心。如用心形的捐款箱会筹到更多捐款。 30.完美礼物哪里找 送礼之前，想办法摸清楚对方真正想要什么，不要自己瞎猜，因为人们收到自己心愿清单上的礼物会更开心，更喜爱。 31.为互助留出余地 你提供帮助后，在回应对方的感谢时，应该暗示期待他的回报，这样你就为“互助”留下了余地。暗示性回答可以是：没关系，如果是我以后需要帮助，你也会这么做的。 32.表达感激好处多 明确表达感激之情会使给予帮助的人感受到更多的社会价值感，有十分明显的积极影响。 33.出乎意料与抛砖引玉 利用“互惠”心理，你可以率先给别人好处，好处越是出乎别人的意料，就越能放大对方积极正向的回报。 34.如何获得帮助 想要求助的人往往低估了对方愿意帮忙的程度。因为求助的人只看到对方帮忙会花费各种成本（时间、精力、金钱），但是其实对方如果拒绝，同样会产生成本（尴尬、丢面子、内疚等）。所以如果真的需要帮忙，尽管开口。 35.先下手为强 两方谈判的时候，哪一方先出价，最终的价格就会定在这个价格附近，这就是锚点效应。所以在谈判的时候，如果有哪个因素能够可以充当锚点，就率先提出来，不要等着对手说，容易被动。 36.报价精确一点儿会更好 一旦提供精确到各位的数字，会让对方认为你提出的数字是经过深思熟虑的，是有额外意义的，因此更容易达到要求。时间也是一样，如“请把材料在15:37分之前交给我”。 37.定价末尾数字有玄机 199元到200元只差1元，但是消费者看上去的效果像是涨了100块一样，消费者更关注左侧的数字，一点改动足以影响客户的购买决定。把跑步机里程设定在9.9公里而不是10公里，能让人有更大动力去完成。 38.顺序改一改，生意滚滚来 我们的决定总是受情境影响，当选项变得复杂时，人们的注意力会集中在最先出现的信息上。在不容易算清的时候，人们更喜欢收益在前面、成本在后面的表述顺序，“付279.99元可以观看580小时节目”，就不如“看580小时的节目收费279.99元”。给我们的启发是：销售时，先说服务、再说报价；求职时，先说取得的业绩总数量、再说你的工作年数。 39.如何事半功倍 不必投入资源去为所有顾客都增加一点儿不起眼的优惠，这就好比往热水里加温水，只会降低整体温度。要用这些资源为少数重点客户提供额外诱人的优惠。激励员工时也是一样。 40.化整为零 说服对方答应一个大请求时，可以先化整为零拆出一个小请求，让对方衡量愿意为小请求付出的代价，之后再把大请求提出来，你就可能得到更多。比如你先让人想想，捐助一个失学儿童他愿意付出多少钱，再让他决定，如果要帮助40名失学儿童他愿意捐款多少。 41.鲜明生动的细节 有具体的细节更更打动人——真实性：清晰具体的手段更能说服人——价值感。想要说服别人，要引导对方关注形象鲜明的受益对象以及清晰具体的实现手段。，既提供真实性，又提供价值感。 42.指出机会成本 机会成本，指的是人们选择了一个方案，就会损失掉其他方案有可能获得的收益。如果产品优惠，就把机会成本讲得清楚、诱人。促销的一个秘诀是，让顾客具体感知到他们买了你的产品之后的“机会成本”。比如你的产品比对手便宜100元，可以让顾客具体设想一下省下来100元还可以买什么，这会促进他们选择你。 43.如何激励他人（还有你自己）完成任务 将注意力引导到小数字上去。任务的前期关注已经完成度——“你已经完成20%啦”；任务的后期关注还剩多少——“你只剩20%就完成啦”。如果你计划减肥，那开始时，多想想已经减掉了多少，到中后期，多想想还有几斤没减掉。盯着比较小的数字，更能激励自己。 44.如何提高客户忠诚度 人们喜欢少做决策，而不是多做，这一点从聚餐时大家都不爱点菜上就能看出来了。当组织一场活动时，如果参与规则简单灵活，则更容易吸引人前来参与，但完成的人更少；如果参与规则严苛，却更容易使人坚持到底完成任务。给更少的决策空间更利于对方的行动。 45.如何让一加一大于二 人们害怕失去，对失去的担忧更胜过对得到它的渴望。因此激励他人的时候，奖品要分类，分梯度，才能更吸引人的注意，会刺激人们“害怕失去”的感觉，因此效果更好。 退后一步看问题 人与问题之间的实体距离会影响他们对这个问题难易程度的印象。远一点，问题显得更容易，近一点，显得更难。所以后退一步、站远一点看问题，就觉得没那么棘手了。 47.从他人的错误中汲取教训 成功难以归为某一单一因素，但是一个错误就能导致失败；负面信息更容易被记住，更有可能影响决策；旁观者清，看别人犯过的错，更容易看出毛病在哪。所以，与其学习如何才能成功，不如学如何避免失败的决策。 48.对错误进行管理 不怕犯错误，只要及时修正就好。要把有限的资源放在“迅速解决问题”上，而是不是牺牲更大的成本追求“零失误”。 49.当天就点评 网购平台的评论中，当评论中没有时间线索的时候，大家更看重负面评论，只要有出现差评，不论还有多少好评，大家都不想买了。但是如果评论中的好评是当天点评的，那么人们更愿意忽视差评而相信好评。 50.给邮件加点料，让谈判更顺畅 让邮件有一些幽默、人情味，更能拉近距离，更容让沟通的事情得以解决。 51.碰触的魔力 碰触能让人跟物件之间产生十分亲密的情感，所以允许潜在顾客摸待售商品会增进好感，当然前提商品摸着要舒服，不能让人难受。 52.把最好的留到最后 人们更容易记住的是体验中的巅峰，与结束时的感受。所以巅峰体验应该尽量放大，结尾的事情考虑周到认真做好，不要让停车场的差评毁掉一次高大上音乐会的体验。如果去旅游，其把预算平均到每一天，不如集中起来做两件有意思的事，尤其是在末尾的时候，不能让最后不愉快影响了对这次旅行的整体印象。 作者：微尘悦读來源：简书著作权归作者所有。商业转载请联系作者获得授权，非商业转载请注明出处。]]></content>

That is me,anyway!恐惧就是这样一个懦夫，当你触及他的底线，接受事情最坏的结果，然后准备和他大干一场的时候，他早就不知道躲到哪里去了。当你找到内心最深的恐惧，把脸转向它，准备作战，恐惧开始烟消云散。【p.028】如果你真的是一个没有安全感的人，你能做的最好的事情，就是在自己最恐惧的地方，无条件的去支持一个人、一些人、一群人。支持别人是这个世界上最安全的事情，它永远不会失败。 IF you’re hurting, you need to help somebody ease their hurt. Ifyou’re in pain, help somebody else’s pain. And when you’re in a mess, you getyourself out of the mess helping somebody out of theirs.安全感是给出来的，不是拿回来的，请你一定要记得。 第二章.让有趣的生命扑面而来【p.035】乐趣来源于全情投入，而不是投入后的结果，正是因为这样，乐趣可以是无条件的。 难怪有些人总是充满快乐和激情，全情投入。他们在成功的时候收获到成果，在失败的时候收获到智慧，而不管什么时候，他们都收获到过程中的快乐！他们为什么不投入呢？他们有这样一个心智模式：冒险——投入！投入是热爱生命的钥匙。什么是快乐？就是做事情既快，又乐！【p.36】不计较钱多钱少肯认真工作的人，往往觉得只要能从事这份工作，本身就是对他最大的报酬。事实上，当一个人为了工作本身而不是工作后的工资来做事情的时候，他往往能够把工作做到最好，也一定会受到更多的报酬。【38】生命就好像镜子一样，“有趣之人”对生活保持着极高的投入度，全力拥抱，生活也全力拥抱他。“无趣之人”用“没兴趣”把自己和生命隔绝，所以生命也躲开他。Dance like nobody’watching; love like you’ve never been hurt.Sing likenobody’listening;live like it’s heaven on earth.带着关爱而不是期待地投入生活，你会发现能力与乐趣接踵而至。寻找那些不能够被满足的深层兴趣，比如爱好、成长、超越自己，快乐、助人、宁静……它们会让你幸福一辈子。为你的生命找到一个长期的、深层的、不能被满足的乐趣，让这个永恒乐趣带领你穿透生命的无常。 第三章.心智模式决定我们的命运【47】《周易.系辞上》说：“仁者见之谓之仁，智者见之谓之智，百姓日用而不知，故君子之道鲜矣”简单的说，你永远只能看到真实世界中，你想看到的那一部分。我们给自己创造了一个世界模型，然后根据这个创造出来的世界生活。这是我们大脑工作的原理。【61】道可道，非恒道；名可名，非恒名。——老子（道可以指导、引领我们的思想，规范我们的行为，并不是恒常不变的理论、道理和规律、名称是可以做出详细的命名和界定，并不是恒常不变的解释和命名。）【62】选择不对，努力白费，错误的努力比不努力还要可怕。每个人都需要给自己未来一个大的方向。【63】如果你是金子，你要做的事是找到让自己发光的方法。这已经不是一个三顾茅庐的时代，今天的诸葛亮需要博客、微博和影响力。只有当你全力投入的时候，你才会从工作中获得快乐。【67】混沌-察觉-醒觉-超越四个步骤，是心智模式升级的必经之路。 第四章.成功学不能学【79】大部分的矛盾与冲突，就是因为双方都在坚持自己的形式，而不是结果。打着爱的旗号来伤人，而且还坚持不懈。佛教中间三毒之一“痴”，就是指这种执著于形式而不是结果的行为。 你今天这样苦苦的坚持，这坚持的背后，是在坚持结果，还只是在坚持形式？【82】很多时候少听成功专家讲的话。所有的创业者多花点时间学习别人是怎么失败的，因为成功的原因有千千万万，失败的原因就一两个点。所以我的建议就是少听成功学讲座，真正的成功学是用心感受的，有一天你就是成功者，你讲任何话都是对的。——马云【84】I gotta keep breathing, Because tomorrow, the sun will rise.Who knows whatthe tide could bring._《Cast away》【86】You got a dream, you gotta protect it. People can’t do somethingthemselves, they wanna tell you you can’t do it.If you want something,go getit.Period 如果你有一个梦想，那就去捍卫它；如果你有一个目标，那就去争取他。走起来！当你走在人生之路上，没有必要去羡慕那些走在高处的人，也没有必要轻视那些走在你后面的人，因为成功不是生命的高度，成功是生命的速度。成功在你此刻的脚下，成功就是越走越近。【84】从词源上来说，success这个词来自中古英语“succeden”，前面是拉丁文前缀”suc”代表“靠近、接近”，后面是一个代表“走”的词根“cess”。所以“success”这个词的本义应该是“越走越近”【87】当你疲惫，那就歇息；当你苦恼，那就哭泣；当你快乐，那就小小的忘乎所以。只要你继续前行，你就在成功。因为成功不在前方，成功就在当下，成功就是越走越近。对自己说：成功就是越走越近，那么我现在就很成功。 A good life is one inspired by love and guided byknowledge.——罗素【88】现代社会的三种毒药：消费主义、性自由和成功学。消费主义以品牌为噱头，以时尚为药效，恋物成瘾；性自由以人性为噱头，以性爱为药效，纵欲成瘾；成功学以速成为噱头，以名利为药效，误导急于走捷径的人上人的年轻人投身其中，投机成瘾。我的野心是要证明一个没有野心的人也能得到所谓的成功。不过，我必须立即承认，这只是我即兴想到的一句俏皮话，其实我连这样的野心也没有。——伍迪艾伦 “Iwould never want to belong to any club that would have someone like me for amember.” 第五章.如何找到热衷一生的事业【93】年轻的时候你可以一见钟情，但是到了年纪你该两情相悦一段，然后选择和一个人白头偕老。即你需要一见钟情很多人，两情相悦一些人，然后才会白头偕老一个人。【101】不递简历也能入职的八种求职方法：1、职业访谈；2、给名人写信；3、混论坛；4、参加培训与学习；5、加入俱乐部；6、义务工作；7、成为客户；8、自由职业【107】如果生命是旅途，你的眼睛就好像探照灯。你永远只能看到你所在之处的一百米处，一百米开外的地方到底怎么样你并不清楚。你能听到很多传奇和故事，但是无法做确切的计划。在你的视野范围之内，你需要精细的计划；在你听说的范围之内，你需要大方向的规划；而在那些你连听都没有听说过的地方，你需要的是相信。【112】平台、资源、眼界、机会、好老板、失败的经验，这都是未来会升值的潜力生命股票，年轻的时候，即使牺牲点别的什么立即可得的利益，也要购买这些东西，他们会在未来的时间里，增值百倍。 不要为一个水杯约束你真正有价值的生命！（2006年的一次职业规划师的交流会上，我问了在座所有人一个问题，如果一个人手里拿着一个水杯，他下一步最好的选择是什么？ 有人说应该去装水，有人说应该与人分享，有人说应该分析自己，用个好的方式去利用水…… 你的答案是什么？我告诉大家，一个人手里拿着水杯，他应该去做自己想做的事情，跟水杯有什么必然关系？） 第六章.原来我还可以这样活【136】受害者深深坚信，自己快乐与否、成功与否掌握在他人手中。 对生命屈服有很多种，最可怕的是那种喜欢被奴役。【141】 Life is not fair,get used to it——比尔盖茨【143】学会如何面对不公平，远远比学会如何评价不公平重要。【146】不公平使我们生命中的契机，是生命提供给我们，让自己和世界变得更加美好的领导机会。【147】Imagine You may say I am a dreamer But I am not the only oneIF some day you join us The world will be as one_——John Lennon 第七章.幸福是一种转换力【161】你不妨把自己的梦想想象成一家上市公司的董事会，你和你的父母对于“你”这个公司都有一定的发言权。他们占有一定的股份。他们有权利发言，有权利表达观点，而你也有义务认真倾听、考虑。但记住在关于你人生的董事会上，你永远是最大的股东。【162】 每个人身上有两套系统，社会系统（男人）负责满足外界要求，换回生活需要。而自我系统（女人）负责满足内心需求，把这些东西转换为我们心灵需要的价值，让我们快乐。社会系统总是去做更有用的事情，女人系统总去做更有趣的事情。【164】社会的你其实不喜欢成功，你喜欢的其实是比别人成功。而自我的你其实也不喜欢成功，你喜欢的是成功的过程与希望。【168】我们很听话地长成为一群有脑无心的人，一群有逻辑没情感的人，一群讲高度不讲尊重的人。我们长成为别人要求的样子，并且以此为荣。就这样，我们把自己弄丢了。 第八章.上天不需要你成功，它只需要你尝试【171】Waiting for life is waiting fordeath.与其在等待中枯萎，不如在行动中绽放。上帝不需要你成功，他只需要你尝试——特蕾莎【172】当一个人等待与拖延的成本，远远高于他真正开始行动所需要的成本，他就会慢慢陷入越等待越不行动的怪圈。我把这种模式叫“等死模式”。等待成本与穿越成本的计算 一旦你陷入了等死模式，最好的选择就是行动起来！穿越过去。因为你等待的成本，远远高于你穿越的成本。【173】死是一件始终要到来的事情，是一件无论你做什么也不会错过的事情。那你又何必这么急呢？——史铁生【177】只有那种不可抑制想开始的开始，才是有结果的开始；而那种能够等几次就没有了的开始，基本上等于冲动。 There is a staying inmy going, there is a going in my staying.——纪伯伦【178】如果你没有一个好的开始，不妨试试看一个坏的开始吧。因为一个坏的开始，总比没有开始强。而完美的开始，则永远都不会到来。 第九章.成长为自己的样子—给残酷世界的温暖规划【186】钱会让你幸福，钱也会让让你失落。但是记住，工作不是用钱来算的。一旦你开始用金钱来代表成就，用价格来代表爱情，用秤来称感情，生活的幸福被你毁灭，是理所当然。【194】其实我们的生命也是一样，我们的生活也由三个支架组成：自我、家庭与团体和职业。这样的支架支撑着我们的灵魂，它在记录我们的生命。你可以不上班，但是你不能不工作！更不能没有朋友圈。跋.拆掉思维里的墙，看到光【201】面对呼啸而至的时代车轮，我们必须加速奔跑，有时会力不从心，有时会浮躁焦虑，但必须适应，它可以轻易地将每一个落伍的个体远远抛下，甚至碾做尘土，且不偿命。——赫尔曼.黑塞 佛教的一个核心观念是“慈悲”，只有先 “慈爱”，才能去“悲”，而所有的爱，从爱你自己开始，然后爱才会从内心满溢出来，流向那些没有爱的地方，变成对世界痛入骨髓的“悲”。很多宗教的教义都讲同一个道理，比如基督教的“福杯满溢”——所有这些智慧，都告诉你：先好好地爱自己，掌控自己的生活，然后慢慢地爱更多的人。 “Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong,have governedmy life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pityfor the suffering of mankind.【202】凡走过的都有痕迹。]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-08-17-Book-YourLifePossible%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[2007年，古典创办新精英生涯，希望帮助30%的青年人：成长，长成为自己的样子。这本《你的生命有什么可能》是他继《拆掉思维里的墙》后，倾三年心力，推出的第二本书。 本书探讨了以下问题：高竞争的工作、高不可攀的房价和房租、 拥挤的交通、糟糕的空气、不安全的食品……在竭尽全力才能生存的时代，年轻人如何追求自己的梦想？在这样的时代，我们的生命又有什么可能？如何才能越过现实和理想的鸿沟，找到和进入自己希望的人生？如何修炼自己在现实中活得更好的能力？如何在现实之中发展自己的兴趣？如何连接现实和理想？如何面对生命里的苦难、贫穷、不完美或者不公正？如何获得心灵的自由？ 在书中，古典谈到了人生四个永恒的主题：影响力、爱、自由、智慧。即使在这个不那么公平的现实世界里，每个平凡人也都能活出各自的生命可能。本书写给成长中的每一个人，以生涯之学和古典的独特人生体验，带领所有好奇、冒失又热爱生命的读者一起成长。生命是一个打开又收拢的过程，这本书将让我们打破自己心智的障碍，开始自由地思考和行走，然后看到人生的更多可能。 语句摘录 序P007如果要把当代年轻人当成一个人，他/她应该是这样的：他的眼睛遥望着5000米外的七色彩虹，心中坚信每个人都平等自由，脚却踩在一片稀巴烂的烂泥之中；他的脑子已经接受了要活出自我的想法，心里却困惑得要死，到底什么才是自己？人生有这么多可能，哪一个才是属于我的？目标有这么多个，哪个背后才是最好的？达成的方式有千百种，到底哪一条路确定能走通？我的想法那么好，家人反对怎么办？有人拼爹怎么办？房子怎么办？ 序P007在这个定不下来的年代，修炼和创造人生反而成为一种最有效的策略—以不变应万变—如果你不知道这世界和你将要去哪儿，最好的策略是先全力炼出一种在哪儿都能活好的能力，在有足够力量和眼界的时候，开始创造自己的人生！今天的人生发展不应该像狙击手，而应该更像导弹—先尽快地发射出去，让自己适应环境的变化，让自己飞得又快又稳；然后每秒都用激光重新定位目标，调整弹道，最后发现目标，一击即中。 序P007-008把修炼本身变成有趣的经历，当过程值回票价，结果也就不那么患得患失了。 序P008-009成长，长成为自己的样子为什么是自己的样子？“自己的样子”意味着每个人都有能力创造自己的生命意义，并且实现它。为什么是成长？“成长”意味着这并不是一个“发现”或者“碰见”的过程，成长是一段漫长、艰辛又神奇的经历，随着每个人起点、天赋和目标的不同，这过程会绽放出无数的可能。 P018只是强调重要性并不会使一件事情变得有趣，过度的强调会适得其反。有趣的事情不一定重要，所以学会让重要的事情变得有趣，才是关键。我们可以理解为什么即使每天告诉学生和员工学习有多重要，每天告诉自己减肥和健康有多重要、改变有多重要，却很少有人回真正有动力去行动。理智带来的驱动力，永远没有情绪发动机—兴趣推动得有力。 没有了兴趣老师的提醒预习，我们只好等生命任务来临再开始补课—我们在该恋爱的时候学习，在该学习的时候玩，在该工作的时候学习，在该结婚的时候又在工作，专注副业一百年。 P028有趣是我们为未来做的准备，给未知的未来的存款。有趣是勇敢者的游戏：有趣的事情可能有用，也有可能无用；有趣是投资能力，而不是消费生活。有趣能让我们拥有越来越多的可能，同时也越来越生机勃勃。 有趣是种活着的、元气淋漓的状态，有趣证明我们还年轻，还在打开新的世界，还在长大，没有长老。 P033-034将自己的挑战程度和技能控制在图示的通道内，你就能一直保持自己的心流；挑战太高而能力不足会让你感到焦虑（如无法通关的游戏、难度太高的工作），而如果能力太高但挑战太低，自会产生厌倦。所以如果你总能让自己停留在通道中，工作就会像游戏和逛街一样好玩。一开始要提高技能（A），一旦感到厌倦了，就马上提高挑战难度（B）,一直到自己觉得焦虑，然后开始学习新的技能，如此循环。这也是游戏设计的原理：在一开始的时候先让你容易升级，也很容易拿到点数，继而逐渐提高升级的难度，也让你掌握越来越难的操作技能。如果游戏设计得好，你会一直玩下去。只要你对于自己的状态有觉察，同时有足够的挑战和技能学习，让工作像逛街一样其实不难。好的教练通过心流设定学习进度，好的电影通过心流设计剧情和镜头惊喜，好的老师通过心流让课堂不知不觉地进行。而你能做的事情，则是找到自己的心流通道的宽度、斜度以及工作方式。 P038在每个队生活和自己不满足的背后，都是每个人成长的需求。 P041用物质填洞的最大的悲剧是：没有人的能力能跑赢欲望，总有一天，你填入了所有东西，却无力地发现，那个空洞还在。物质也许能带来短暂的一次次快乐，但绝非幸福。你占据的东西，也在占据你。 P42-43席慕蓉《独白》：在一回首间，才忽然发现，原来，我的一生的种种努力，不过只是为了周遭的人都对我满意而已。为了要博得他人的称许与微笑，我战战兢兢地将自己套入所有的模式、所有的桎梏。走到途中，才忽然发现，我只剩下一副模糊的面目，和一条不能回头的路。 你以为大家都喜欢和离不开你，其实是你离不开他们的喜爱。 P043“你看，这个地方没做好啊。”“其实，我天生就不是做**的料！”因为手臂上的一个小地方发炎，你不愿意面对，就把整条手臂都剁了下来。你放弃了痛苦，但也放弃了自己。 P048我们总在自己最有把握的事情上花最多时间，却不太愿意待在最重要却把握不大的部分。 不冒险其实是最大的冒险。要持续舒服的最好方式是让自己不舒服。 P049正如每一次新生都伴随着母亲的痛苦，每一种痛苦都是新生的启示，你要学会读懂它。 P050当成长比成功更重要、过程比结果更重要、价值比价格更重要时，你就拥有了看透却不被看破的心态。这种转变创造出一种更大的智慧：以入世的心态来玩，却以出世的心态来发现价值。这格局孕育着更大的成长速度，成功是成长，失败也成长。成功能让你获得成就，失败能让你获得智慧，智慧又在孕育新的成功。 P052死亡是人类最好的礼物，当生命有了限度，每个人的价值就会浮现。 P054如果你觉得非得和别人的价值观一致，不然就活不下去，是因为你有个隐藏价值观叫“他人认同”。 P056当我们断言这个或那个具有“价值”时，我们是在表达我们的感情，而不是在表达一个即使我们的感情各不相同也仍然是可靠的事实。 那些告诉你“你的价值观有问题”的人，其实在说：“你的价值观和我不一样。”价值观根本没有标准答案。好的生活，不是对不对，而是值不值。 P064我们需要明白路标并非终点，目标并非目的，月亮并非手指。我们可以走不同的路，达到最终的目的。 P073定见的所有修炼，都是为了有一天面对他人的期待时，淡淡地微笑，说一句：谢谢，这很好，当是我有更重要的事情要做。 P074-075一个人总在推动身边的人去做某事，其实那是他内心未竟的愿望。 P087对于大部分工作，认真努力就有80分。以大部分人的努力程度之浅，他们根本没有做到80分。如果你只是希望通过找到天赋少付出些努力来超车，你就根本没有资格谈天赋。 P100当你全心投入，这过程就值回票价，回报只是个惊喜。 P101等待一个确定的机会才开始投入的人，机会永远等不及你。当下即道场，在任何时候做到极致，看似最笨，往往却是最聪明的。 P104如果你每一步都希望听到掌声，那么也许你只能永远在自己舒服的小天地玩。只有那些敢于走得更远的人，才知道自己到底有可能到哪儿。 P105你不能预先把点点滴滴穿在一起；唯有未来回顾时，你才会明白那些点点滴滴是如何穿在一起的。所以你得相信，你现在所体会的东西，将来多少会连接在一块儿。你得信任某个东西，直觉也好，命运也好，生命也好，或者业力。这种做法从来没让我失望，也让我的整个人生不同起来。--乔布斯在斯坦福大学的演讲 P106真正优秀的人，会认真做好每一件事情—因为他们知道即使老板不为认真发工资，未来也必会给认真发工资。因为你知道有一天，连点成线，功不唐捐。 P110能整合自身的能力，叫竞争力；能整合团队的能力，叫组织力；能整合公司的能力，叫领导力；能整合行业的能力，就是改变世界的能力。 P129每个渴望成为独立个体的人，都需要创建自己的定见。定见不诞生于别人的建议之中，而是在自己一次次的试错里。我们不是“找”到自己的样子，而是“成长”为自己的样子。 后悔没试过和后悔做砸了的量级永远不一样，前者让你更懦弱，后者让你更智慧。 P136不要向现在的职业最高点方向走，要向未来的职业方向走；不要做现在能兑换价值的事情，要做未来能兑换价值的事情。 P139原来成功与能力不完全相关—成功不能证明你真的有价值，当龙卷风袭来，猪都会飞；不成功也不能证明你很糟糕，那只是下一个故事的开始—关键是走在路上的状态。我们慢慢明白，成功就是用自己的节奏越走越近。 P159好的生命，是有事做，有人爱，有问题可想，有选择的自由。 P162立体的生涯让我们的生命有了更多可能—在更多领域找到那些能够改变的限制，而接纳那些不能改变的限制。我们身处现实的残酷、社会的不公平、人生的不平等，但依然能找出自己的人生发展方向，活出自己更好的可能。 P170欣赏是总能绕过对方的缺陷，看到真正美丽的部分。 P219关于梦想，最可悲的不是你暂时没有，而是有一天出现的时候，你却发现自己完全够不着。 如果你暂时找不到自己清晰的梦想，那么踏踏实实地做好现在这份职业，让自己努力向顶峰走去。在上山途中积累的所有一切都会在梦想出现时刻，转化为自我实现的力量。 写给愤怒的你：愤怒是好的， 愤怒意味着我们依然生机勃勃，依然没有被现实压倒屈服，依然愿意对世界感到不满，依然认为世界能比现在好。但愤怒也意味着我们把自己幸福的可能性托付于对方。愤怒是因为自己的无力感，没有力量仅凭自己就让生活过好，愤怒同时意味着我们无法真正改变这个世界，因为我们从属于它。比愤怒更加好的态度，我想是善待自己。如果这个世界无法温柔地善待你，你一定要记得温柔地善待自己。如果能够再进一步，就是悲悯。 写给怕走弯路的你：人生无直线，因为直线从不转弯。而转弯和改变，是人生必经之事。何况，你不走点弯路，怎么知道什么是直线呢？ 写给不完美的你：专注于生命可能的部分，让那部分发挥价值，此生就已足够。“让我有胸怀去接纳不可改变的，有勇气去改变可以改变的，并有智慧区分两者。” 写给爱自由的你：如果世界没有给我们选项的自由，但我们总有选择的自由。在你暂时无力为别人的错误负责的时候，最好的方式不是指责，这个世界都翻船，重要的是先把自己捞出来。总有人在你生命力犯错，但是只有你在你的生命里负责。 写给弯弯（他女儿）同样也送给你的话：记得要活得精彩，活得认真，跟自己比。愿你过上我从未看见与理解的生活。愿你的生命有无限可能。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[比较 WSGI、FastCGI 和 CGI 的异同]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-08-14-IT-WSGI_FastCGI_CGI%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[扩展阅读：https://www.biaodianfu.com/cgi-fastcgi-wsgi.html CGI（Common Gateway Interface） 最初，CGI 是在 1993 年由美国国家超级电脑应用中心（NCSA）为 NCSA HTTPd Web 服务器开发的。 这个 Web 服务器使用了 UNIX shell 环境变量 来保存从 Web 服务器传递出去的参数，然后生成一个运行 CGI的独立进程。CGI的第一个实现是 Perl 写的[1]。 效率低下：每一个连接 fork 一个进程处理。功能十分有限：CGI只能收到一个请求，输出一个响应。很难在CGI体系去对Web请求的控制，例如：用户认证等。正因为这些问题，在CGI诞生后的很长一段时间，各种WebServer都还是采用API这种强绑定的方式去支持Web开发，其中Apache的mod_php就属于这种方式。所以后面就有大神提出了FastCGI标准。 FastCGI（Fast Common Gateway Interface） FastCGI使用进程/线程池来处理一连串的请求。这些进程/线程由FastCGI服务器管理，而不是Web服务器。当进来一个请求时，Web服务器把环境变量和这个页面请求通过一个Socket长连接传递给FastCGI进程。所以FastCGI有如下的优点： 性能：通过进程/线程池规避了CGI开辟新的进程的开销。兼容：非常容易改造现有CGI标准的程序。语言无关：FastCGI是一套标准，理论上讲只要能进行标准输出（stdout）的语言都可以作为FastCGI标准的Web后端。下面是一个简单FastCGI后端的伪代码void main(void){ int count = 0; while(FCGI_Accept() &gt;= 0) { printf(“Content-type: text/html\r\n”); printf(“\r\n”); printf(“Hello world!\r\n”); printf(“Request number %d.”, count++); } exit(0);} Web Server隔离：FastCGI后端和Web Server运行在不同的进程中，后端的任何故障不会导致Web Server挂掉。专利：没有Apache mod_php之类的私有API的知识产权问题。扩展：FastCGI后端和Web Server通过Socket进行通信，两者可以分布式部署并方便进行横向扩展。所以FastCGI一推出就几乎获得了所有主流Web Server的支持，Apache、Lighttpd、IIS、Cherokee…… But，事情总是还有改进的余地的，FastCGI这套工作模式实际上没有什么太大缺陷，但是有些不安分的Python程序猿觉得，FastCGI标准下写异步的Web服务还是不太方便，如果能够收到请求后CGI端去处理，处理完毕后通过Callback回调来返回结果，那样岂不是很Coooool？！所以WSGI就被创造出来了： WSGI（Web Server Gateway Interface） Web服务器网关接口（Web Server Gateway Interface，缩写为WSGI）是为Python语言定义的Web服务器和Web应用程序或框架之间的一种简单而通用的接口。 当Web Server收到一个请求后，可以通过Socket把环境变量和一个Callback回调函数传给后端Web应用，Web应用在完成页面组装后通过Call back把内容返回给Web Server。这样做的优点有很多： 异步化，通过Callback将Web请求的工作拆解开，可以很方便的在一个线程空间里同时处理多个Web请求。方便进行各种负载均衡和请求转发，不会造成后端Web应用阻塞。Web开发有3P：Perl、Python、PHP。Perl是1987年发布的，Python是1989年，PHP是1995年。CGI标准提出的时候正是Perl如日中天的时候，所以CGI的提出当时也是主要为了解决Perl作为Web编程语言的需求。熟悉正则（regex）的程序员可能知道正则的事实标准叫做pcre（Perl兼容正则表达式，Perl Compatible RegularExpressions），这也从一个侧面体现了Perl作为一个古老的语言在当时对各种业界标准的影响。 作者：auxten链接：https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/20054757来源：知乎著作权归作者所有。商业转载请联系作者获得授权，非商业转载请注明出处。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[这是一本关于西方哲学的入门书籍，讲述了西方哲学的变迁与继承，可以说是一本西方哲学的编年史。作者以他一贯的朴素、易懂的语言讲述着那些晦涩的理论，予人以启迪和清醒，给人留下深刻难忘的印象。 当我们学会了怀疑，尤其是怀疑自己的信念和原则时，哲学便产生了 在这个世界上，只有三件事值得人们去奋斗。这就是正义、真理和美。 培根，“有一技之长的人蔑视学问，无知的人则仰慕学问，只有聪明的人才善于运用学问，学问本身并不能教人怎样运用它，这种运用学问的智慧只有通过观察才能获得，它是在学问之外和学问之上的。” 这一位位非常有名的哲学家带给人类的感觉也是不同的，有些是乐观的，有些是悲观的；有些是封建的，有些是开放的；有些是信仰佛神的，有些则是无神论者。他们的认识世界，认识社会的观点都不一样，但都存在着意义，对于某些人来说，亚里士多德的理论更适于他的人生，但对于另一些人来说，柏拉图的思想才更了解他自己内心的想法，每个人都是不一样的，所以哲学也并不存在对与错。而这些有名的哲学家也给了我们一定的启示和一定的信心和力量，所以，让我打开知识的大门，去寻觅和哲理一样美妙的知识吧！ 哲学的魅力，琳琅满目，光华深邃，我们必须更多的琢磨和思考。在这些大师们面前，我们肃穆，我们敬畏，我们仰望，我们沉思，以冀灵魂的洗练与升华。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[• 深度了解事件系统（event system）。 Salt 基于消息队列（message queue）构建。命令首先由 Master 产生任务（job）并推送到队列中。Minion监听队列中能够匹配到自己的任务。当 Minion 获取到一个任务时，会尝试执行和自己相关联的任务。一旦任务完成，会将任务的执行结果发送到另外一个Master 监听的队列。 Minion 并不是只能处理由 Master 产生的任务，自身也具有发送（fire）消息的能力。这些信息块就构成了基本的事件总线（event bus）。 事实上有两个事件总线：一个是 Minion 内部沟通（并不能和其他 Minion 通信）的总线，另一个是 Minion 和 Master沟通的总线。Minion 的事件总线目前应用在 Salt 内部，只用于自身内部产生事件使用。当然也允许用户手动或甚至编程地在 Minion消息总线上发送消息（firemessage），但对于用户来说并没有内置直接的高级用法。 Master事件总线则完全不同。Minion发送消息到Master的能力是很强大的，尤其是Master结合反应器系统（Reactor system），我们将在稍后详细介绍它。 • 理解反应器（Reactor）系统。 • 构建更复杂的反应器（Reactor）。 • 使用队列系统（queue system）。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[心理暗示力-唤醒最好的自己 - (法) 埃米尔·库埃著]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-07-20-Book-SuggestivePower%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[心理暗示的魅力做心想事成的自己世间有一种法则，叫吸引力法则；因为，宇宙中存在一种法则，叫吸引力法则。——“具有金钱意识的人经常吸引金钱，具有贫穷意识的人总是引来贫穷。通过你的思想、语言和行为，它们将为你所意识到的事物打开道路，无论富有或贫穷，都恰如你所想的状况那样满足你。” 小心暗示的阴影每一个人的意识在自我运转的时候都会产生种种习惯性的思维，这些思维就像是刻刀，在潜意识的木板上留下一条条深深的刻痕。如果这些思维是积极的、向上的、有益的，那么潜意识就会雕刻出一幅精美的、壮阔的、成功的画卷。相反，如果这些思维是消极的、颓废的、灰暗的，那么潜意识中留下的就只能是一块被刻得乱七八糟的木板。 其实，人生中的种种，生命中的一切一切，财富也好，健康也好，幸福也好，快乐也好，都与暗示力息息相关。积极的暗示就像是太阳，带给我们明媚与美好，消极的暗示则像是阳光下的阴影，让人颓丧与苦痛。但无论是阳光还是阴影，晴天还是阴天，实际上都是我们自己的选择。天堂地狱，不过一念之间，而这一念，源于我们自己！ 激发你强大的气场气场是一种生命的特质，是一种通过肢体、语言、行动等表现出的身心状态。 官场中不怒自威的领导，商场中纵横捭阖的巨擘，职场中如鱼得水的精英，等等，都是气场强大的人。他们被同事认同，被朋友欣赏，被下属爱戴，被旁人艳羡，不是因为其他，正是因为他们内心信念的强大。 心理暗示和催眠术心理暗示力是催眠必不可少的助力！没有心理暗示力的参与，催眠不可能完成，更不可能成功！ 按照催眠程度的不同，也可以划分为三类，即深度催眠、中度催眠和浅度催眠。在浅度催眠状态下，被催眠者能够随意行动，睡意不强，清醒之后能记起催眠过程中的所有事情；中度催眠状态下，被催眠者不能随意行动，睡意较强，清醒之后只记得催眠过程中的部分情况；而深度催眠状态下，被催眠者睡意很强，不能随意行动，清醒之后完全不记得催眠状态下的任何事情。这种状态下，被催眠者完全受催眠师的支配，如果催眠师心存歹意，对病人来说将是一件非常危险的事情。 研究表明，在催眠状态下，人体会分泌出一种非常奇特的物质，这种物质不仅能够减轻痛苦，还能加快伤口的愈合，相比于人工的麻醉药，这种叫作内咖肽的天然麻醉剂无疑更加有效而实惠。而且在避免认知冲突方面，催眠术的效果也非常好。举个例子来说，如果用蓝色的墨水写一个“红”字，然后询问同一个人写字的墨水是什么颜色的，在未被催眠的状态下，被问者做出回答的时候会犹豫甚至会答错，但在催眠状态下却能毫不犹豫地给出正确答案。 心理暗示的魔力潜意识的美容师一个坚信自己很美丽的人，不会懈怠去打扮，相反，他（她）会主动装饰与诠释自己的美丽，并将这份美丽带给周围所有的人，在得到赞美的同时更加坚信自己的美丽，从而进入一个“美丽—化妆—更美丽”的良性循环中。 音乐疗法调查显示，一些特定的、舒缓的、轻快的音乐能够与人体产生一种神奇的频率共振，让人因为恐惧、压力、焦虑等种种原因超负荷的身体渐渐放松下来，让人血压降低、心率恢复正常、呼吸重新变得平稳、代谢再次充满活力。 除了放松，音乐还有许多神奇的作用，比如，调节大脑的平衡能力、安神醒脑、增强智力等作用。研究表明，不听音乐的人心情指数普遍都偏低，而经常听音乐的人不仅人生态度更加积极，而且寿命也要长很多。 个人磁场如果你想成功，你可以每天早晨面对镜子说：“每一天我生活的每一个方面都在越变越好！”这句话每天要重复说15次以上，坚持一个月，你会发现神奇的效果。你渴望成功的潜意识增强了，身上自信的磁场增强了。 奇妙的精神脸谱心情图谱的画法： 首先，准备好纸笔，然后在白纸上画出一条横向的直线（当然，你也可以选择纵向，这没什么大不了）。 直线画好了？很好，让我们接着进行下一步：将直线平均分成十个刻度，用1-10这十个数字分别标记出来。不要告诉我你不会画，这和画数轴没有任何区别，数学课上我们都学过。 好吧，数轴完成，一切准备工作就绪，最重要的步骤现在开始：像我一样，静下心来想一想，不用想什么美好或者糟糕的事情，那太复杂，我们只需要想一些词汇，确切地说是三类词汇。 一类是用来描述坏心情的，如忧伤、焦虑、痛苦、愤怒、悲痛、郁闷、烦躁、沮丧等； 一类是用来描述一般心情的，如平淡、无趣、平静、索然无味、麻木等； 一类是用来描述好心情的，如高兴、兴奋、满足、幸福、欣慰、感恩、快乐、激动等。 想好了？不错。下面，和我一起，选出十个词汇，对，就是十个词汇，一个不能多，一个不能少，并且，请注意，这十个词汇必须将上述三大心情类别全部都包括进去。 选好后，按照坏心情——一般心情——好心情的顺序依次将它们写在数轴的十个刻度上。如1-痛苦，2-焦虑，3-烦闷，4-孤独，5-平静，6-淡定，7-欣慰，8-快乐，9-兴奋，10-幸福。 写好了？那么，参照这个心情图谱，来衡量一下你自己的心情吧。 假如你刚刚被公司辞退，内心十分的痛苦，那么你的心情指数毫无疑问是1；假如你婚姻美满、工作轻松、生活优越，满心幸福，那么你的心情指数自然就是10；如果你刚刚被上司表扬，职位得到晋升，既快乐又兴奋，那么你的心情指数则是8.5。 不要怀疑，事实上，心情图谱虽然很简单，但它却能最直观地表现出一个人的情绪，能最简单地表明一个人的心情特点。 假如一个人的心情指数总是在相邻的两个数字之间徘徊，不是1就是2，不是9就是10，那么这个人的心情图谱就比较单一，情绪也非常稳定；相应的，假如一个人的心情指数波动非常大，前一刻是2，下一刻就变成了9，前一刻是10，下一刻就变成了1，忽悲忽喜，那么这个人的心情图谱就很细腻很丰富，但他的情绪却又非常的不稳定。 除此之外，通过心情图谱，我们还能看出许多其他的东西，比如，一个人的心态和人生态度：假如一个人的心情图谱长期偏左，心情指数总是在5之下徘徊，那么这个人必然是一个消极的人；相反，如果长期偏右，则表明这个人非常乐观，心态也十分积极。 心理暗示的关键一蹴而就只是梦路要一步一步地走，饭要一口一口地吃，心理暗示也一样。 暗示影响潜意识，潜意识影响我们的行为，适当的行为能够将理想转化为现实，然而，这一切都需要潜移默化，都需要时间。罗马不是一天建成的，任何目标的实现也不可能一蹴而就，它需要持续关注，需要不断重复。 对！持续！重复！这两点很重要！ 记住，一蹴而就只是梦！ 记住，告诉自己：“每一天，我生活的每一个方面都在变得越来越好！” “吸尘器”必不可少举个例子来说，一个人想要创业，想要致富，但他拿不准自己应该走哪条路，应该做什么来创造财富，他担心投资失败，他会设想创业过程中遭遇的种种困难，会迟疑，会犹豫，会放弃，会前怕狼后怕虎，这都没什么，人之常情而已，但一旦他做出了某种决定，比如要开一家理发店，并且已经租好了店面，正在装修，那么，这个时候，再去患得患失就完全没有意义了，这个时候，一切的消极思想都是累赘，是灰尘，应该被清除。只有这样，创业者才可能成功。 期望毋庸置疑心理暗示的规律就是信念！ 相信自己的信念，相信自己的期望，不要怀疑，一丝一毫的怀疑也不能有！ 暗示力是力量之源，而信念则是暗示力之源。 我们的信念，我们心中的坚持，才是暗示力的核心，是影响潜意识的关键。这是真理！ 你的潜意识，你的暗示力只忠实于你内心最真实的信念，只反应你内心最真实的思想，只回应你心中最真实的期望，所以，不要信口开河，不要随随便便地许诺，如果你真的想成功，真的期望成功，期望健康，期望幸福，期望快乐，那么，就不要去质疑自己的期望，一丝一毫都不可以！ 期望成为亿万富翁？可以！但你要保证你的内心也是这样想的，你要保证你真的想要成为亿万富翁，你要保证你相信自己能够成为亿万富翁。如果你做不到，那么，抱歉，暗示力的神奇作用不会发生在你的身上。我的理论对你来说也只是谬论，而我，并不承认自己是一个骗子。 期望身体健康？可以！但你要保证你的内心真的对健康充满了渴望，你要保证你真的想要身体健康，你要保证你真的相信自己的身体会健康。如果你做不到，如果你在期望健康的同时还怀疑自己得了这样那样的疾病，还想着种种“不健康的征兆”，那么，抱歉，暗示力不能给你带来健康。 古今中外，祈祷从来都是最神秘也最常见的“克服困难”的方式，人们在遭遇窘境的时候也常常会选择祷告。这不是迷信，而是心理暗示的一种。 祷告的时候，人们的思想相对纯粹，祷告者对“神灵”也充满了信任，他们相信神灵能够为他们解决困难，相信神灵能够创造奇迹，不知不觉地，他们的脑海中就会形成一幅问题解决之后的画面，就会出现一些摆脱困境之后才会出现的美好景象，这些景象出现的多了，出现的时间长了，就会形成一种特别的暗示，当潜意识接收到这一暗示的时候，会将它当作真实的情况进行反应，于是，“上帝”就真的显灵了，问题迎刃而解。 记住这句话：只要我们相信，我们每一个人都是自己的上帝。 放松的奇效例子：明天你要参加高考，你知道自己需要充分而良好的睡眠，你早早地就躺在床上，告诉自己我要睡觉，但最后你却失眠了。 诸如此类的例子在日常生活中其实有很多，你越想做成某件事就越做不成，你越想找到某件东西就越找不到……这很正常。是的，很正常。你的意志对行动干预得太多了，在意志的强迫命令下，你的大脑和身体会过分紧张，会超负荷运作，紧张疲累又会带来无尽压力，压力过大了，焦躁、不安、疲累等种种负面情绪就会接踵而至，失败、事与愿违也就没什么好奇怪的了。 当意志力和心理暗示力发生冲突的时候，胜利的通常都是暗示力，但这并不是说意志力在暗示力面前是毫无抵抗力的，也不是说显意识在潜意识面前就甘愿退却。相反，意志力很强大，显意识也很强大，当强大的意志横亘在暗示和潜意识之间的时候，暗示其实很难进入潜意识，而没有暗示的参与，潜意识本身并不会与意志力发生对抗，更不会去争什么。 暗示力、潜意识发生作用的条件就是没有意识，是放松，是顺其自然。如果你刻意去强调什么，刻意去暗示什么，那么这种暗示其实已经算不上是暗示，而是明示，是命令，是意志了。 放松有奇效，自我暗示之前先放松，去除压力，效果会出奇的好。 放松的三种方法： 方法一：冥想。找一个能让你最舒服的姿势，坐下，然后慢慢地呼吸，对，慢慢地吸气，慢慢地呼气，一次，两次，三次……注意你的呼吸，注意你的心跳，不要太久，一小会儿就好，然后，调整你的身体平衡，让重量均匀的散布到身体的各个部位，然后，轻轻地告诉自己：“放松，放松……” 好吧，你放松了，对吗？ 方法二：对叶想象法。找一片树叶，柳树叶、杨树叶、梧桐树叶，什么树叶都可以，仔细地观察它，观察它的形状、颜色、脉络，然后闻一闻它的气味，摸一摸它的质地，接着，合上眼睛，想象你进入了一片树林，想象一下你在林中看到了什么，听到了什么，感觉到了什么，闻到了什么，触摸到了什么，在想象的树林中徘徊一阵后，回到你原来的位置，再默默地回味一遍，最后深呼吸十次，缓缓地睁开眼睛。 然后……你难道还没有放松吗？ 方法三：空明法。这个最简单，平躺在床上，深呼吸一分钟，什么都不要想，在心中默念：“放松，放松”，反复多次，然后，你放松了。 打开密室的钥匙我的地盘我做主无谓的攀比，畸形的比较，用别人的标准来衡量自己的价值，这样的行为，就像是将自己的地盘完全交给别人，让别人做主一样，滑稽而可悲。 我们独一无二，所以，我们不必去仰望，不必去敬畏，不必去羡慕。 接受真实的自己我们总认为自己能力有限，认为自己不够优秀，但实际上我们的能力比自己所认识的强大万倍，我们自身也比自己印象中的优秀千万倍。我们完全可以不断地进行自我肯定，我们完全可以在潜意识中为自己勾勒出一幅又一幅美好的画面。虽然这样的美好看上去很虚妄，它不能让我们拥有超能力，也不能给我们带来财富和权力，但它的神奇却毋庸置疑。因为，它给我们带来了契机！它就像是一个好的导师，引领着我们真正地认识自己，进而接受真正的自己。 送自己一束玫瑰“积极的思考能够带来成功”“我一定能够做到”“假设是一种法则”“拥有坚定的信念比拥有任何才华都更重要”“你怎样看待自己，别人也会怎样看待你”“想最倒霉的事就是最倒霉的人”“想最快乐的事就是最快乐的人”——事实上，这些关于怎样创造幸福、开拓未来、缔造财富、拥抱成功的观点并不是我的独创，它来自于库埃先生，一位令人尊敬的学者，是他第一次揭示了获得成功人生的心理根源。他常告诉人们：“每一天，我生活的每一个方面正在变得越来越好。”这句简单而又蕴含深刻哲理的话，我非常喜欢。 不要抗拒演讲美国著名人际关系学大师、心灵圣经《人性的弱点》的作者戴尔·卡耐基曾经做过一个非常有趣的调查：他询问他的学生，你为什么要来上我的课？你想要从我的课上学到什么？在卡耐基看来，自己得到的答案应该是五花八门、千奇百怪的，然而，事实却和这位大师开了一个不大不小的玩笑：他得到的答案的确很多，但这些答案却惊人的相似！ “我想要表现自己，但我又害怕表现自己。当我被要求站起来回答问题、自我介绍或者做其他陈述的时候，我不知道自己应该怎么办，我浑身不舒服，我感到不自然，我的大脑仿佛一下子就乱了。我不知道该怎么说话，我不知道该如何去思考，我的注意力无法集中，我不知道自己要表达什么，更不知道应该如何表达。因此，我来了。我想获得自信，我想大大方方地站起来讲话，我想侃侃而谈，我想在社交场合如鱼得水，我想在公众面前思维清晰，我想让自己的话更有说服力，我想让自己的气场变得更加强大。”百分之九十以上的答案，概括起来，便是如此。 内心的攻防战固守内心的城墙坚守自己内心的城墙，不受任何消极的外源暗示的影响，让建设性的积极暗示占据自己的内心。 人生的重塑离不开暗示的帮助“想要”激发正能量你的潜意识只相信你“想要”的，只顺应你“能”的，你“不想要”的，你“不能”的，它绝对不会给你。换句话说，想要才是硬道理，才能激发正能量。专注于你想要的事物，专注于你想要办成的事情，专注于你想要完成的目标，专注于你想要实现的梦想，只要你能用自己的专注将这些全部都清晰地传达给潜意识，它就会给你回应，帮你实现。 还是那句话，切记，你“想要”的东西中千万不要包含否定的词汇，否则潜意识肯定会断章取义。 潜意识的能量就像是一条河，你挖出怎样的航道，它就会怎样流淌；你引导它流向哪里，它就会流向哪里。正如吸引力法则所说的那样，正能量吸引正能量，负能量吸引负能量，积极的思想吸引积极的事物，消极的思想则吸引消极的事物。 把握主动权，人生不设限如果上帝告诉你，你将来肯定能成为一位市长，你肯定不会满足于只当市长，而是希望自己能够成为总统。人就是这样，未知才能带来恐惧，因为未知，因为不知道自己的极限在哪里，才会轻易地说放弃，才会轻易地交出人生的主动权。 所以，不要迟疑了，牢牢把握人生的主动权吧，这是你天生的权力。什么？你不知道怎样把握？那么，跟着我念： 我能行！我一定行！ 我相信自己！我爱自己！ 我一定会成功！我一定会幸福！我一定会快乐！我一定会健康！ 多念几遍，每天都念，念的同时不要忘记去展开行动！只要你这样做了，即便是命运女神，也无法将主动权从你的手中抢走。 榜样的力量很伟大因为职业的原因，我曾经出入过许多成功人士的书房或办公室，他们或是政府官员，或是企业家，或是技术精英，或是银行家，他们的办公室和书房布置风格也各有不同，或典雅，或古朴，或简洁，或庄重，或浪漫，或时尚，但他们的书房办公室却有几个共同点，那就是都有一些画像，如著名金融家的画像、杰出政治家的画像；都有一条或几条标语，如“我成功，因为志在要成功”“只有经历过地狱般的折磨，才有征服天堂的力量”。 陈设自然是普通的陈设，但它们却又不普通，因为它们无时无刻不散发着暗示的力量！ 挥舞暗示的魔棒 游刃人生人才是暗示练成的许多人说，人的性格来自于遗传，但事实上，调查显示，遗传因素对人性格的影响并不太大，后天的环境，或者说是后天生活环境中，来自周围人和父母的暗示才是决定人的性格的最关键因素。 所以，无论你是不是有孩子，无论你有没有获得父母的殊荣，都记住这句话：用积极的暗示包裹孩子，让孩子在暗示中健康成长，这是培养人才的最佳方式。 教育领域的误区一块原木，如果你用斧头将它劈成柴火，那么它就只能在锅炉房中燃烧；如果你用雕刀把它雕刻成一尊木雕，那么它就会出现在展卖艺术品的货架上；如果你将它放在原地不管不问，那么它就会在森林中慢慢地腐朽。 我们的孩子，其实就是一块原木，是成为木雕，还是成为柴火，是走入多彩的人类社会，还是默默地在森林中腐朽，实际上，全部都取决于教育。 人才需要爱的浇灌父母们必须要注意，你可以争吵，但不要当着孩子的面争吵；你可以粗鲁，但在孩子面前请保持优雅；你可以卑微，但请让孩子看到你的高大；你可以胆怯，但不要让孩子看到你的胆怯；你可以抱怨整个世界，但请不要让孩子觉得这个世界是灰暗的；你可以愤怒、悲伤、颓丧，你可以酗酒、抽烟、怒骂，但，还是那句话，不要让你的孩子看到！ 说服是一种技术活儿说服是一门技术活儿，暗示的力量想要发挥也需要其他方法的配合，而不断地反问无疑是一个非常不错的方法。假如你不相信或者对此心存疑惑，不妨去试试，试着去改变你朋友、亲人、同事的想法吧，不过，你必须注意一点，你不能心怀恶意，并且，你也没有必要为了试验而付出被讨厌的代价。 学习成为一个暗示高手有一次我去买车，碰到一个非常有意思的销售员，他卖车的时候，从来不主动向客户推荐车型，也从来不说“我觉得您该买……”这样的话。他会将身段放得很低，像个小学生一般请客户指点他，让客户觉得一切都是自己在主导，而这位推销员说的话却很少，只是在关键的时候用请教的口吻提上那么一两句，不知不觉中，客户就按照推销员的期望买了车，而且，客户会非常满意，因为他没有被推销员“牵着鼻子走”，一切都是自己的选择。但，实际上呢？ 一个高明的心理暗示专家，绝不会让被暗示者觉得自己接收了暗示，而是会让被暗示者觉得一切都是自己在做主，很显然，无论是那位委婉的副总裁，还是格莱特以及推销员，都是这样的高手。 要成为“高手”，你就首先要明白一点：人与人相处的时候，第一行为并不是吸引，而是本能的排斥。所以，要想成为“高手”，你就要先做到让别人不排斥你，你就要懂得人际交往中的三种特殊心态： 第一，接近心态。 第二，相似心态。 第三，互补心态。]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-07-19-Book-MurphysLaw%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[“墨菲定律”（英文：Murphy’s Law）主要内容有四个方面： 任何事都没有表面看起来那么简单； 所有的事都会比你预计的时间长； 会出错的事总会出错； 如果你担心某种情况发生，那么它就更有可能发生。 “墨菲定律”的根本内容是“凡是可能出错的事有很大几率会出错”，指的是任何一个事件，只要具有大于零的机率，就不能够假设它不会发生。 成立条件： 事件有大于零的概率； 样本足够大（比如时间足够长，人数足够多等） 在科学和算法方面，它与英文所谓的“worst-case scenario（最劣情形）”同义，数学上用大O符号来表示。例如，对插入排序来说，最劣情形即是要排序的阵列完全倒置，必须进行 n*(n-1) 次的置换才能完成排序。在实验上，证明了最劣情形不会发生，并不代表比它轻微的情形就不可能，除非能够很有信心的推论事件的概率分布是线型的。 墨菲定律的原句已经派生出以下的版本： 别试图教猫唱歌，这样不但不会有结果，还会惹猫不高兴。 别跟傻瓜吵架，不然旁人会搞不清楚，到底谁是傻瓜。 不要以为自己很重要，因为没有你，太阳明天还是一样从东方升上来。 笑一笑，明天未必比今天好。 好的开始，未必就有好结果；坏的开始，结果往往会更糟。 你若帮助了一个急需用钱的朋友，他一定会记得你——在他下次急需用钱的时候。 有能力的——让他做；没能力的──教他做；做不来的──管理他。 你早到了，会议却取消；你准时到，却还要等；迟到，就是迟了。 你携伴出游，越不想让人看见，越会遇见熟人。 你爱上的人，总以为你爱上他是因为：他使你想起你的老情人。 你最后硬着头皮寄出的情书；寄达对方的时间有多长，你反悔的时间就有多长。 东西越好，越不中用。 一种产品保证60天不会出故障，等于保证第61天一定就会坏掉。 东西久久都派不上用场，就可以丢掉；东西一丢掉，往往就必须要用它。 你丢掉了东西时，最先去找的地方，往往也是可能找到的最后一个地方。 你往往会找到不是你正想找的东西。 你出去买爆米花的时候，银幕上偏偏就出现了精彩镜头。 另一排总是动的比较快；你换到另一排，你原来站的那一排，就开始动的比较快了；你站的越久，越有可能是站错了排。 一分钟有多长？ 这要看你是蹲在厕所里面，还是等在厕所外面。 计划没有变化快。 欠账总是要还的。 做恶总是要遭报应的，不是不报，只是时间未到。 该来的总是要来的。 明天又是一个新的开始。 你越是害怕的事物，就越会出现在你的生活中。 往往等公车太久没来，就走了的人，刚走公车就来了。 关键时刻掉链子。 越想要什么就越不能得到什么。 人出来混，总是要还的。 怕什么，来什么。 若想人不知除非己莫为。 你上班经常带的一样东西（U盘/银行卡/会员卡等等），当有一天你觉得反正天天带都用不上，不带了。而实际可能就在你没带它的那一天，你真的就需要它了。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[思考，快与慢 - 丹尼尔·卡尼曼]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-07-14-Book-ThinkingFastSlow%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[人类究竟有多理性？——思考，快与慢在书中，卡尼曼会带领我们体验一次思维的终极之旅。他认为，我们的大脑有快与慢两种作决定的方式。常用的无意识的“系统1”依赖情感、记忆和经验迅速作出判断，它见闻广博，使我们能够迅速对眼前的情况作出反应。但系统1也很容易上当，它固守“眼见即为事实”的原则，任由损失厌恶和乐观偏见之类的错觉引导我们作出错误的选择。有意识的“系统2”通过调动注意力来分析和解决问题，并作出决定，它比较慢，不容易出错，但它很懒惰，经常走捷径，直接采纳系统1的直觉型判断结果。为了使读者真切体会到系统1和系统2这两个主角的特点，卡尼曼介绍了很多经典有趣的行为实验，指出我们在什么情况下可以相信自己的直觉，什么时候不能相信；指导我们如何在商场、职场和个人生活中作出更好的选择，以及如何运用不同技巧来避免那些常常使我们陷入麻烦的思维失误。本书将会彻底改变你对思考的看法。 50 年前，人们以为我们能驾驭自己的思想。但事实上，我们的行为常常受到许多无法看见的因素所影响。我们虽然身处生活这场游戏之中，但对游戏的机制却不理解，偏见常常导致我们追求错误的东西。我们的感知和记忆并不可靠，对于自己心理状态的感知和记忆尤其不可靠。 关于人类自身还有许多未知之谜，对于自己，我们了解得其实不多。卡尼曼就如思想的拓荒者，他的研究成果为我们认识自我提供了重要的支点。卡尼曼对于人类思考和选择的理解所作出的贡献，无人能出其右。作为历史上最重要的一位心理学家，卡尼曼重塑了认知心理学、理性和因果关系分析，重新诠释了风险，重新阐释了幸福和财富的关系，写就了这部杰作。如果你今年只能读一本书，就读这一本吧。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[20世纪人类最大的病痛是“心灵的沦丧”。心灵沦丧的我们物质越来越丰富，却越来越感觉不到幸福；相处的技巧越学越多，婚姻关系却越来越难搞；经历的事情越来越多，感动却越来越少。针对当下的种种问题，本书提供了一种新的解决方式。它无需高深的哲理，更与医学技术无涉，你只需要重新审视日常生活，就能找回久违的快乐与满足。其实，精心挑选的一束鲜花、浆洗得干干净净散发着香味儿的桌布，这些微末细节都可以滋养干涸已久的心灵，让我们从中获得满足与幸福。 人的一生有许多追求和目的，这是我们人生的动力。许多人在生活中遭受惨败，不是因为他们的追求和目标错误，而是不能用合理的方法去达到自己的目标。 我们可以运用一些工具来使自己能合理地达到自己的目的，这是现代社会人生活的一套积极的“纪律”；也是人们生活的基本原则： 不逞一时之快; 承担责任; 忠于真相; 保持平衡。 这些纪律使我们处理问题更为合理；是几种解决我们生活中的痛苦和让我们寻求到快乐的工具。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[GRAINS 组件是saltstack中非常重要的一个组件，其主要用于记录Minion的一些静态信息，如比：CPU、内存、磁盘、网络等。grains信息是每次客户端启动后自动上报给master的，一旦这些静态信息发生改变需要重启minion 或者 重新同步下 grains。除此之外我们还可以自定义Grains的一些信息。自定义的方法有三种：1、通过Minion配置文件定义；2、通过Grains相关模块定义；3、通过python脚本定义。 1.查看Grains相关的命令及用法(sys.list_functions or sys.doc) salt ‘‘ sys.list_functions grains2.获取主机item信息(grains.ls or grains.items) salt ‘‘ grains.items3.根据Grains的分组应用,筛选win系统 salt -G ‘os:Windows’ test.ping4.通过Grains模块定义Grains5.使用自定义python脚本获取grains信息 - 获取主机系统时间 默认自定义脚本需要存放在master的/srv/salt/_grains目录下，这里使用mkdir -p创建即可。这里一个获取系统时间的脚本内容如下： [root@saltmaster _grains]# cat get_time.py #!/usr/bin/env python coding=utf-8from datetime import datetimedef get_server_time(): grains = {} grains[‘server_time’] = datetime.now().strftime(‘%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S’) return grains使用sync_grains命令同步脚本到minion主机上去，并通过grains.item命令获取相关信息即可，如下： [root@saltmaster _grains]# salt ‘‘ saltutil.sync_grainsserverb.pod0.example.com: - grains.get_timeirora200: - grains.get_time[root@saltmaster _grains]# salt ‘‘ grains.item server_timeserverb.pod0.example.com: -——— server_time: 2014-04-02 23:53:23irora200: -——— server_time: 2014-04-02 15:53:23执行同步命令后，自定义脚本会上传到minion的/var/cache/salt/minion/extmods/grains目录下。 [root@irora200 grains]# lsget_time.py get_time.pyc[root@irora200 grains]# pwd/var/cache/salt/minion/extmods/grains 进阶: 使用grains搭建自动监控工具 http://rfyiamcool.blog.51cto.com/1030776/1266437/]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-07-04-OpenSource-SaltNote%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[研究slatstack时踩过的坑，注意点及解决方案运行问题 1、直接物理性移除minion或者更换minion原先连接的master，会导致先前的master始终无法ping通minion [root@localhost salt]# salt ‘*’ test.pingminion_centos7: Truewin_minion: True10.1.240.193: Minion did not return. [No response]解决办法：在master上查看已接受的key [root@localhost salt]# salt-key -LAccepted Keys:10.1.240.193minion_centos7win_minionDenied Keys:Unaccepted Keys:Rejected Keys:把删除的那台minion的key删除就好了 [root@localhost salt]# salt-key -d 10.1.240.193其他汇总 1、minion安装的版本不同可能会导致master的部分请求解析失败，master同理 解决办法：查看minion的版本，升级或降级，务必统一版本 2、遇到一次同步后的grains为空白的情况，grains空白后导致整个minion连接异常，无论执行任何正常命令，报错都是minion无响应，与minion不在线的提示相同 不知什么原因，目前怀疑是与salt的modules命名相同或者是grains中有异常代码导致。前者还好处理，后者的话可能要加安全校验机制 解决办法：cd到/var/cache/salt/minion/extmods/grains/路径，把与modules同名的文件删除即可，不行的话清空整个目录内的文件 windows系统的解决办法差不多，找到安装目录下的grains存放位置，把异常的文件删除即可，比如我传来的grains是存放在C:\salt\var\cache\salt\minion\extmods\grains 3、saltstack模块内部出现错误时，salt内部抛出且不会回显，但是调用该模块时会出现问题，所以若模块调用正常，但写成api时结果不正常，有可能是模块的问题 4、minion上的防火墙服务firewalld开启可能会导致Minion did not return. [No response] 如果需要传参的话，最好不要用debug模式，因为-l debug这些字符可能传参处理时会引发异常从而导致运行失败 5、由于salt返回的一律是字典型，所以将输出写入文件时一定要转化为字符串，用str处理就好 6、可用**kwargs来接收不限数量的参数，但外部参数必须用kwargs[‘__pub_arg’][0]来获得，而且一旦不能转化为字典型就会报错 7、传送大文件时，有时返回成功，但是传送文件的目录里，文件名后面有个.part证明传输异常中断了 8、salt-master的ip有时会变，若配置文件没相应变更ip，重启salt时会提示[WARNING ] Unable to bind socket,error: [Errno 99] Cannot assign requested 9、写grains时，grains的模块名字命名不可以与grains.item 的命名相同，否则只会输出none]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-06-13-Book-StructureThinking%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[芭芭拉·明托的《金字塔原理》算得上大名鼎鼎，今天阅读的这本《结构思考力》算得上是中国人写的金字塔原理实操手册。本书的核心理念、主要内容均源自于芭芭拉·名托的《金字塔原理》，全书197页，以金字塔原理这一工具的应用为主要框架，但也新增很多内容，从结构化思考的角度，以更通俗的方式教给人们在思考和表达方面的理念和方法。 一、介绍结构思考力的2w1h在介绍结构思考力的时候，作者提出了一个“2w1h”的概念： 为什么要用结构思考力（why）作者认为，结构思考力是组织中所有人必备的基本技能。在我们思考和表达方面，都有一个基本的思路。可以帮助我们: 在解决问题时，迅速抓住主要矛盾，忙而不乱地应付各种问题。在重大决策时，快速理出重点，勇敢科学果断地作出决策。在材料写作时，能够主体明确，结构严谨，层次清晰。在沟通表达时，语言准确，思路清晰，快速终总结说话要点。在对下指导时，能快速确定目标，明确计划，理清核心。 什么是结构化思考方式（what）这是一个很好的逻辑框架培训。虽然看起来只是一个简单的先总后分的思考和表达方式，强调先框架后细节，先总结后具体，先结论后原因，先主要后次要。 核心是先总后分的思考脉络，掌握事物的关键本质和问题的关键，从总体到局部的鸟瞰而不拘泥于细节。结构思考力拥有横向和纵向两种思维结构。在思考时既要运用横向结构拆分总体问题，又要运用纵向结构，对某些方面内容进行深入的分析探索。 如何将结构思考力应用于思考和表达（how）作者借用金字塔框架，将结构思考力的应用分成了三大阶段五个步骤。三个阶段分别是基础阶段，构思阶段和演示阶段。五个步骤则是 明确理念打基础基于目标定主题纵向结构分层次横向结构选顺序形象表达作演示 掌握这三大阶段五个步骤，就是结构思考力精髓。 二、明确理念打基础在这个章节中，作者把结构思考力也就是金字塔原理的基本特点，分两个部分进行了详细的介绍。 1.结构思考的四个基本特点 结论先行的表达，一次表达只支持一个思想，而且要在开头表达出来。先框架后细节。 以上统下的论证，在任何层次上的思想都必须是下一层次思想的总结概括。 归类分组的论据，每一个组的思想必须在同一个范畴之内，使之条理清晰模块化。 层层递进的逻辑，每一组的思想，按照一定的逻辑顺序进行处置，更容易让对方理解和记忆。 2.结构化接收信息的三个步骤如何清晰的找出别人说话中传递信息的结构，并有效地概括出核心内容呢？这需要自己具备结构化思考的能力，能够从繁杂的信息中识别关键点，理解他人的核心内容并且能总结的条理清楚。为此作者提出了三个步骤: 第一步，识别信息中的事实理由以及结论，找出信息中哪些是观点类的，哪些是事实描述类的信息，观点类的信息哪些是结论，哪些是理由，并将其区分开来。 第二步，找出事实与观点的对应关系，并画出结构图。然后，找出这些事实和观点的对立关系，依据事实、理由、结论的对应关系画出金字塔结构图。 第三步，一句话概括出所有内容。接受信息除了前两步做到听清楚以外，最后还要简单扼要地概括出所有内容，做到说明白。这里作者给出了一个说明白的公式： 在 基础上，从 ， ， ， ，N个方面，说明了 。。。 三、明确目标定主题构建有说服力的金字塔结构，一定要先明确目标，设置合适的主题，并以有效的方式（序言）引出主题。作者在明确目标这个部分，提出了一个ABCD目标法来进一步明确目标，很有创意。所谓ABCD目标法，就是把目标分解成ABCD四个要素去分解考虑： 受众（Actor）：接收方是谁条件（Condition）：在什么样的条件下行为（Behavior）：完成什么样的任务或表现出怎样的行为程度（Degree）：达到（实现）什么样的标准或水平 在如何设置主题的部分，作者依然用金字塔原理的方式，主题也要先基于目标确定结论，然后精心包装主题以打动人心。引入主题的时候，需要包含一个讲故事的结构。这需要四个要素：情景，冲突，疑问，回答。简称为SCQA。 情景就是一个大背景。冲突是在这个背景下发生了哪些变化的问题。疑问是如何在这个背景下解决问题。答案就是解决问题方案。 适当的调整是各要素的顺序，可以有效地表达不同情绪，让听众们引发共鸣，让沟通更加有效。 四、纵向结构分层次作者提出来，人们的思维同时具备两种能力，一种是从目标出发沿不同路径分解探求答案的能力，我认为这是一种演绎的能力。另一种则是把各种信息聚合起来得出一个解决方案和结论的能力，我认为这其实是归纳的能力。因此所谓的纵向结构分层次，活学活用归纳和演绎思维方式，分层次搭建框架，聚合总结概括思路，让自己的表达有理有据。归纳和演绎并不是什么新鲜的东西，但作者在这本书里增加了很多新的亮点，比如设想问题，从对方角度出发的新模式，强调要站在对方的角度去设想问题，换位思考，切实找到对方到底关心什么，如何解答对方最容易接受。再比如作者把5w2h思考问题的方法，精简到2w1h的核心问题设想法。强调想清楚说明白的是: 是什么为什么如何做？ 从这个框架出发，推导到1-2-3简易结构思考力的模型。所谓123，就是说1个中心思想，2w1h基本框架，3点理由。然后以上统下，结论先行。可以让自己思路清晰呈现。 五、横向结构选顺序在横向结构中关键还是归纳和演绎两种思维方式，帮助自己进行归类分组和逻辑递进。把一组具有共同特点的思想归类分组并概括出结论叫做归纳论证。而对演绎过程的概括，演绎推理过程的层层步骤叫做演绎论证。在司法考试复习以及实际工作中，演绎论证的机会比较多，就是经常使用的三段论大前提，小前提和结论之间的横向分析。比如说: 大前提偷窃犯罪小前提张三偷了别人的东西结论是张三犯了罪 所有的法官判案都离不开三段论。作者在这个部分特别指出了一个关键点——不要把现象和原因混为一谈，或者没有分析原因直接凭借现象作出判断。具体应该使用演绎还是归纳方法进行沟通，其实是根据自己的需要而定的。 当需要说服对方时，我们应该多使用演绎论证。 而当对方关注解决实施方案的时候，使用归纳论证的方式可以让人更加容易记住要点。 六、形象表达做演示作者这个章节中，教给人们如何将已经打好的结构，通过类比、引用和整合的方式进行包装，以便让对方更容易记忆并接受自己的观点。其中对我最有启发的一点就是作者强调“每页ppt都是一个金字塔结构”。这是我在很多ppt学习使用教材中没有看到的，在这里作者用结构里的四个基本特点，进行详尽的讲解。 结论先行。要求在ppt中每一页的标题必须是一个有中心思想的主题句 以上统下。每页ppt的主题，都是下面要点的概括。 归类分组。每页ppt的要点，都相互独立，完全穷尽，不遗漏，不交叉。 逻辑递进。每页ppt的要点，都必须按照一定的逻辑顺序组织。 七、阅读感受这本书切实做好了“身体力行”四个字，在此之前，我一直对结构化思考薄有微词，认为不过是我们小学语文老师教的“总分总”的外国翻译而已，如此推崇这个思考模型有故作玄虚的嫌疑。而且，结论先行的原则可能也更适用于老外们那种直来直去的文化，未必适合我们。但是阅读完这本书以后，我的立场有了180度的大反转，因为我们在学生时代应试或学习拆解课文的总分总技巧，和实际工作沟通中的结论先行本来就是全然不同的两种情境，而结论先行本身是一种沟通技巧和思维方式，却不是一种文化，我们使用结构化思考模式，并非一上来就“告诉你一个坏消息”的生硬，而是一种让对方更清晰准确了解自己意图的坦诚。 其他三层次模型 第一步:理解，隐性思维显性化这是基于我们对事物的看法，我们对事物的价值认定，我们潜意识反射的个人观点。在信息大爆炸的当下，在事件繁杂众多的当下，在啰里八嗦讲不清重点的对话当下。我们严重需要清晰重点，简化时间。我们需要识别信息中的事实，清晰自己的观点认准自己的选择；判断事实与观点的对应关系；能用一句话解释清楚所有内容。 而这个识别概括万能公式，在_的基础上，从_几个方面说明了___。就能够让我们把我们自己的理解观点，呈现出来。 第二步:重构，显性思维结构化把我们已知的内容进行重新排序，这就需要用到我们四个核心原则 结论先行:先总后分的立体化思维，先表明结论观点，会让对方清晰了解你要阐述的重点是什么。不会让对方不耐烦，高效节约双方的时间。 以上统下:阐述的观点要与论据相互对应，这样更准确，更有说服力更不容易被对方挑战。 归类分组:通过相应的特性进行分类，会让我们更加记住内容事物的本身，知识管理也好，收纳整理也好，这都需要归类分组。⒈MECE原则相互独立，完全穷尽，可以让我们的梳理更清晰更全面。 ⒉5±2原则，更好的让我们提出观点，提出报告作出总结。因为人的大脑一次性接受的信息量是有限的，7条是我们能接受的临界值，太多会显得的内容繁杂记不住，太少会显得根据不稳定，不牢靠。而3则是稳定结构，任何一个总是能够以三条作出总结，提出报告，提出观点的人，都是有结构思考力的人，因为他有自己的观点，有自己的判断，自己的独立思考。 逻辑递进:顺序非常重要，它有可以让我们的观点逻辑更加严谨，更有说服力，一般分时间顺序（先后），结构顺序（总分），重要性顺序（主要，次要）这三个。 第三步:呈现，结构思维形象化 基于金字塔结构原理制成的结构罗盘，是从四种关系十六个呈现模式来更好地让结构思维形象化。 流动模式:线性，流程，循环，关联 作用模式:对立，合力，平衡，阻碍 关系模式:并列，重叠，包含，分割 比较模式:成分，排序，序列，关联 怎样更好的呈现内容，让别人眼前一亮？ 首先我们要做的就是“配关系”，在流动模式，作用模式，关系模式，比较模式中，找到其主要模式，然后“得图示”从这四个模式中找到更好体现内容呈现形式的模式，最后“上包装”:简化（拆，隔，删，突）类比（形象，行为）引用（广告，歌曲，名言，流行语）整合（字母，数字，颜色，部位） 第一节 Why——结构思考力的作用非凡 3 第二节 What——强调“先总后分”的立体化思考方式 .8 第三节 How——将结构思考力应用于思考和表达 12 第一章 明确理念打基础 20 第一节 结构思考力的四个基本特点 21 第二节 结构化接收信息的三个步骤 43 思考力体操 58 第二章 基于目标定主题 59 第一节 确定目标——让表达有的放矢 61 第二节 设定主题——让表达观点明确67 第三节 设计序言——让表达更吸引人 73 思考力体操 78 第三章 纵向结构分层次 79 第一节 自上而下——疑问回答做分解 80 第二节 自下而上——概括总结做聚合 100 第三节 上下结合——两种方式不可分 120 思考力体操 125 第四章 横向结构选顺序 126 第一节 选择演绎——让说服更有力 129 第二节 选择归纳——让要点更清晰 141 第三节 因需而动——两种顺序选其一 170 思考力体操 172 第五章 形象表达做演示 173 第一节 卖点包装——让观点容易记 174 第二节 形象表达——让演示更有效 179 思考力体操 191 后记 不忘初心，方得始终 192]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[逻辑学的主题是清晰地思考。它既是一门科学，也是一门艺术。逻辑，作为一个整体，是个宽广、深奥、精彩纷呈的领域，《简单的逻辑学》这本书既没有刻板的理论论述也不是正规的教科书，这是一本现实应用的指南，对那些初次接触逻辑的人介绍逻辑的基本原理。《简单的逻辑学》期待造就实践者，而不是理论家。 我们中国向来就没有逻辑学——中国古代的圣人几乎穷尽了一切真理，但他们偏偏忘记了发明逻辑。 圣人们也不是忘记了发明，其实他们是不需要发明。他们依靠直觉、顿悟，直抒胸臆地寻找真理，什么推理、论证统统不需要；只要福至心灵，答案往往脱口而出。翻翻四书五经，里面圣人说的全都是答案，一句话顶一万句；这些答案怎么来的，圣人们自己不在意，也没有人关心，后来人只要记住这些标准答案就行了。 圣人如此，老百姓呢？好像也不需要——他们没有什么需要证明、也没有地方需要说理。中国有三纲五常，谁老大谁说话算数，君要臣死臣不得不死，哪有你有讲理的份？中国老百姓哪怕是打官司也不需要说理，到衙门里面去告状，谁对谁错由官老爷来判。黎鸣先生说过，只有一个讲理的民族才需要逻辑，一个不讲理的民族根本就不需要逻辑。这话听着刺耳，但并不是胡说八道。 现在怎么样了呢？我不是很清楚，我只知道现在的学校依然不教逻辑学，除非你读的是西方哲学系。 确实，逻辑和麦当劳一样，是西方的一种发明。和东方人不同，西方有一种理性传统，他们什么都喜欢推理、证明一番，甚至连上帝都需要逻辑证明。中世纪的神学家阿奎那一个人就提出了五种关于上帝的证明。 推理、论证是一种理性活动，必须有一种方法来作为保证。这种方法最初是由亚里斯多德（这位老先生后来被称为“西方逻辑之父”）发明的，叫做逻辑。从此之后，随着喜欢说理的人越来越多，逻辑这种方法也越来越完善。在这个武库中，不断有新东西添加进来，除了形式逻辑之外，还有数理逻辑、符号逻辑……许多杰出的西方头脑都为此做出了贡献，比如培根，康德，弗雷格，还有罗素。 和麦当劳不一样的是，喜欢逻辑的人并不多；我也是最近看了一本《简单的逻辑学》才知道这些的。 这本书的作者是美国逻辑教授麦克伦尼；为了不把我们吓跑，他删繁就简，把逻辑这个大学问说的很简单。 麦先生说，逻辑的原理很简单。逻辑（主要是指形式逻辑）最基本的规律只有四个。 第一是同一律:意思是，什么东西就是它本身，不是别的东西，如果用符号表示，就是：A是A。 第二是矛盾律:就是说互相矛盾的东西不可能同时为真，必有一假：A不是非A。 第三条叫排中律:和矛盾律相反，就是说互相矛盾的东西不可能同时为假，必有一真：A或者非A。 还有充足理由律:这个原理是说，天下的事都有存在的原因。毛主席那句关于无缘无故的名言，应用的就是这个原理。 麦先生还说，逻辑论证的形式也很简单，只有两条——演绎，归纳。从一般推出个别就是演绎，从个别推出一般就是归纳。例如，你从所有的乌鸦都是黑的，判断某一只乌鸦是黑的，你就是在演绎推理；你看到一只乌鸦是黑的、又一只乌鸦是黑的……许多只乌鸦是黑的，你判断天下的乌鸦一般黑，你就是在归纳推理。 麦先生说这是简单逻辑学，看来还真不是谦虚，这里确实没有令人震惊的深奥东西。恐怕有人看了会偷笑，这算什么原理呀？谁不知道A就是A！我没有笑，据我所知，许多人其实并不知道A就是A。我太太就是典型例子。她经常振振有词地说，我是好人，我从来不做坏事；你反对我，你就是坏人。因为不懂逻辑，所以她根本不知道自己是犯了“循环论证”——把结论A当作前提B——的逻辑错误。 麦先生把逻辑学说得这么简单是为了引诱这些外行。其实逻辑一点也不简单。简单的只是它的原理，而不是它的威力。据说，正是有了这种简单的逻辑，西方才有了哲学，才有了科学，才有了今天独步天下的文明！这是不是真的我不敢妄加评说，但我可以在这里做一个小小的比较。 我们知道，在事实与真理之间，或者用逻辑的话说，在前提与结论之间有一条很深的鸿沟。如何跨越这条深沟，东西方的古圣人采取了不同的方法。我们的圣人是一跃而过。孔夫子说，学而时习之，不亦说乎？为什么“学而时习之”，就“不亦说乎”？他没有说明，他只是直接说出“说乎”结论。而亚里斯多德的结论是用另外的办法得出的。比如，他说苏格拉底是要死的，为什么要死呢？因为人都是要死的，苏格拉底是人，所以，苏格拉底是要死的。从前提到结论，他没有纵身一跳，而是在深沟上搭了一座“三段论”的逻辑之桥，一步一步走过来的，我们看得见、也学得到。有了他搭的这座桥，我们每个有理性的人，只要愿意，谁都可以一步一步沿着它走向彼岸。相比之下，对孔圣人我们就只有敬仰的份了。他是圣人，可以凌波微步直接跳过来；我们是凡人，不得要领，只能望沟兴叹——既不晓得别人是怎么过的沟，也不晓得自己如何过这个沟。 把逻辑比作一座桥、当作一种工具，也许本身就不很逻辑。但作为一个门外汉，我确实找不到更逻辑的办法，权且当作是学习麦先生的简单主义的一个尝试吧。确实，在这本薄薄小书里，就如何使用逻辑这个工具，麦先生为我们介绍了一些很有用的要领。 作为工具，第一个问题就是要用它来干什么？对此，作者说得非常明确，逻辑学的“全部目的”就是一个，找出真相。逻辑本身不是目的，逻辑来源于现实，逻辑要反映现实。换言之，如果你不是为了发现真理，你即使把逻辑搞得滚瓜烂熟也没有意义。逻辑是用来讲理的、论证的。不打算讲理的人、存心骗人的人是不需要学习逻辑的。 作为工具，还有一个问题就是如何使用。任何一种工具本身都有自己的问题。逻辑也不例外。比如归纳，它虽然可以帮助我们得出结论，但并不能保证这个结论完全正确。前面提到，我们通过观察，可以归纳出“天下乌鸦一般黑”的结论，但这个结论是绝对真理吗？不一定，因为谁都不可能看到所有的乌鸦，只要有一只白乌鸦，你的推论就玩完。 即使逻辑是完全有效的，依然还是有问题，工具都是双刃的，逻辑可以用来讲正理，也可以用来讲歪理。这本书的作者专门用两章的篇幅，列举了种种讲歪理的谬误。比如，偷换概念，滑坡论证，恶性循环……看过这些谬误之后，我不禁倒抽一口凉气：妈呀！难道我听到的那些振振有词的道理，许多都是没有逻辑的鬼扯？比如，我以前只要看“毫无疑问”，“毋庸讳言”，“不言而喻”，“事实已经证明还将继续证明”……诸如此类的话，就马上肃然起敬、点头称是。现在才知道这种说法是缺乏逻辑的“独断论”，它违背了充足理由律。充足理由律告诉我们，这个世界上没有不言而喻的事情；任何一个观点，都必须提供证明。 还要说明的是，逻辑这个工具也不是万能的。不管你的逻辑水平有多高，谈情说爱、夫妻吵架时千万要慎用。如果你太太抱怨说：如果不是当初瞎了眼下嫁你，她早就是富婆了。你千万不要反驳她犯了“虚假假设”的逻辑错误，因为爱情是没有逻辑可言的。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[你想建设一个能承受500万PV/每天的网站吗？ 500万PV是什么概念？服务器每秒要处理多少个请求才能应对？如果计算呢？ PV是什么：PV是page view的简写。PV是指页面的访问次数，每打开或刷新一次页面，就算做一个pv。 计算模型：每台服务器每秒处理请求的数量=((80%总PV量)/(24小时60分60秒40%)) / 服务器数量 。其中关键的参数是80%、40%。表示一天中有80%的请求发生在一天的40%的时间内。24小时的40%是9.6小时，有80%的请求发生一天的9.6个小时当中（很适合互联网的应用，白天请求多，晚上请求少）。 简单计算的结果：((80%500万)/(24小时60分60秒40%))/1 = 115.7个请求/秒((80%100万)/(24小时60分60秒40%))/1 = 23.1个请求/秒 初步结论：现在我们在做压力测试时，就有了标准，如果你的服务器一秒能处理115.7个请求，就可以承受500万PV/每天。如果你的服务器一秒能处理23.1个请求，就可以承受100万PV/每天。 留足余量：以上请求数量是均匀的分布在白天的9.6个小时中，但实际情况并不会这么均匀的分布，会有高峰有低谷。为了应对高峰时段，应该留一些余地，最少也要x2倍，x3倍也不为过。115.7个请求/秒 2倍=231.4个请求/秒115.7个请求/秒 3倍=347.1个请求/秒23.1个请求/秒 2倍=46.2个请求/秒23.1个请求/秒 3倍=69.3个请求/秒 最终结论：如果你的服务器一秒能处理231.4–347.1个请求/秒，就可以应对平均500万PV/每天。如果你的服务器一秒能处理46.2–69.3个请求，就可以应对平均100万PV/每天。 说明：这里说明每秒N个请求，就是QPS。因为我关心的是应用程序处理业务的能力。 实际经验： 根据实际经验，采用两台常规配置的机架式服务器，配置是很常见的配置，例如一个4核CPU+4G内存+服务器SAS硬盘。 个人武断的认为在服务器CPU领域Intel的CPU要优于AMD的CPU，有反对的就反对吧，我都说我武断了（请看CPU性能比较），不要太相信AMD的广告，比较CPU性能简单办法就是比价格，不要比频率与核心数，价格相差不多的性能也相差不多。 硬盘的性能很重要，由其是数据库服务器。一般的服务器都配1.5万转的SAS硬盘，高级一点的可以配SSD固态硬盘，性能会更好。最最最最重要的指标是“随机读写性能”而不是“顺序读写性能”。（本例还是配置最常见的1.5万转的SAS硬盘吧） 一台服务器跑Tomcat运行j2ee程序,一台服务器跑MySql数据库,程序写的中等水平(这个真的不好量化)，是论坛类型的应用(总有回帖,不太容易做缓存,也无法静态化)。 以上软硬件情况下，是可以承受100万PV/每天的。(已留有余量应对突然的访问高峰) 注意机房的网络带宽：有人说以上条件我都满足了，但实际性能还是达不到目标。这时请注意你对外的网络的带宽，在国内服务器便宜但带宽很贵，很可能你在机房是与大家共享一条100M的光纤，实际每个人可分到2M左右带宽。再好一点5M,再好一点双线机房10M独享，这已经很贵了（北京价格）。一天总流量：每个页面20k字节*100万个页面/1024=19531M字节=19G字节，19531M/9.6小时=2034M/小时=578K字节/s如果请求是均匀分布的，需要5M（640K字节）带宽（5Mb=640KB注意大小写，b是位，B是字节，差了8倍），但所有请求不可能是均匀分布的，当有高峰时5M带宽一定不够，X2倍就是10M带宽。10M带宽基本可以满足要求。以上是假设每个页面20k字节，基本不包含图片，要是包含图片就更大了，10M带宽也不能满足要求了。你自已计算吧。 附：性能测试基本概念 基本概念：Throughput（吞吐量）：按照常规理解网络吞吐量表示在单位时间内通过网卡数据量之和，其中即包括本机网卡发送出去的数据量也包括本机网卡接收到的数据量。一个100Mb(位)的双工网卡，最大发送数据的速度是12.5M字节/s ， 最大接收数据的速度是12.5M字节/s， 可以 同时 收发 数据。并发用户数：是同时执行操作的用户(线程数)。响应时间：从请求发出到收到响应花费的时间 。QPS - Queries Per Second 每秒处理的查询数（如果是数据库，就相当于读取）TPS - Transactions Per Second 每秒处理的事务数(如果是数据库，就相当于写入、修改)IOPS，每秒磁盘进行的I/O操作次数例如对某个数据库测试，分开两次测QPS与TPS。QPS（读取）值总是高于TPS(写、改)，并且有倍率关系，因为： 数据库对查询可能有缓存。 机械硬盘或SSD硬盘的读就是比写快。 JMeter测试参数说明：Label：每一个测试单元的名字。Samples：表示一个测试单元一共发出了多少个请求。Average：平均响应时间——默认情况下是单个 Request 的平均响应时间，当使用了 Transaction Controller时，也可以以Transaction 为单位显示平均响应时间。，不重要。Median：中位数，也就是 50％ 用户的响应时间，如果把响应时间从小到大顺序排序，那么50％的请求的响应时间在这个范围之内。重要。90% Line：90％ 用户的响应时间，如果把响应时间从小到大顺序排序，那么90％的请求的响应时间在这个范围之内。重要 。Min：最小响应时间，不重要。Max：最大响应时间，出现几率只不过是千分之一甚至万分之一，不重要。Error%：本次测试中出现错误的请求的数量Throughput：吞吐量——默认情况下表示每秒完成的请求数（Request per Second），当使用了 TransactionController 时，也可以表示类似 LoadRunner 的 Transaction per Second 数 KB/Sec：每秒从服务器端接收 到的数据量(只是接收)，相当于LoadRunner中的Throughput/Secloadrunner测试参数说明：响应时间： 取90%值，如果把响应时间从小到大顺序排序，那么90％的请求的响应时间在这个范围之内。重要。每秒点击数 ：hits per Second,每秒钟向服务器提交请求的数量。TPS： Transaction per Second ，每秒事务数，一个事务是指一个客户机向服务器发送请求然后服务器做出反应的过程Throughput（吞吐量）： Loadrunner记录的Throughput是接收到服务器返回的所有字节数之和，与本地发出的字节数无关。Throughput/Sec： 每秒的吞吐量。对于BS架构的一般分析 响应时间、点击率、吞吐量、TPS（每秒事务数）。 对于CS架构的一般分析 TPS（每秒事务数）Apache ab测试参数说明：RPS： Request per Second,每秒处理的请求数]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Mike从他的角度归纳这篇论文中的其他一些核心观点，如下： 第一定律 Communication dictates design 组织沟通方式会通过系统设计表达出来 第二定律 There is never enough time to do something right, but there is always enough time to do it over 时间再多一件事情也不可能做的完美，但总有时间做完一件事情 第三定律 There is a homomorphism from the linear graph of a system to the linear graph of its design organization 线型系统和线型组织架构间有潜在的异质同态特性 第四定律 The structures of large systems tend to disintegrate during development, qualitatively more so than with small systems 大的系统组织总是比小系统更倾向于分解 人是复杂社会动物 第一定律 Communication dictates design 组织沟通方式决定系统设计沟通成本 = n(n-1)/2，沟通成本随着项目或者组织的人员增加呈指数级增长。是的，项目管理这个算法的复杂度是O(n^2)。举个例子 5个人的项目组，需要沟通的渠道是 5*(5–1)/2 = 10 15个人的项目组，需要沟通的渠道是15*(15–1)/2 = 105 50个人的项目组，需要沟通的渠道是50*(50–1)/2 = 1,225 150个人的项目组，需要沟通的渠道是150*(150–1)/2 = 11,175 第二定律: There is never enough time to do something right, but there is always enough time to do it over 时间再多一件事情也不可能做的完美，但总有时间做完一件事情 第三定律 There is a homomorphism from the linear graph of a system to the linear graph of its design organization 线型系统和线型组织架构间有潜在的异质同态特性 康威定律如何解释微服务的合理性了解了康威定律是什么，再来看看他如何在半个世纪前就奠定了微服务架构的理论基础。 人与人的沟通是非常复杂的，一个人的沟通精力是有限的，所以当问题太复杂需要很多人解决的时候，我们需要做拆分组织来达成对沟通效率的管理 组织内人与人的沟通方式决定了他们参与的系统设计，管理者可以通过不同的拆分方式带来不同的团队间沟通方式，从而影响系统设计 如果子系统是内聚的，和外部的沟通边界是明确的，能降低沟通成本，对应的设计也会更合理高效 复杂的系统需要通过容错弹性的方式持续优化，不要指望一个大而全的设计或架构，好的架构和设计都是慢慢迭代出来的带来的具体的实践建议是： 我们要用一切手段提升沟通效率，比如slack，github，wiki。能2个人讲清楚的事情，就不要拉更多人，每个人每个系统都有明确的分工，出了问题知道马上找谁，避免踢皮球的问题。 通过MVP的方式来设计系统，通过不断的迭代来验证优化，系统应该是弹性设计的。 你想要什么样的系统设计，就架构什么样的团队，能扁平化就扁平化。最好按业务来划分团队，这样能让团队自然的自治内聚，明确的业务边界会减少和外部的沟通成本，每个小团队都对自己的模块的整个生命周期负责，没有边界不清，没有无效的扯皮，inter-operate, not integrate。 做小而美的团队，人多会带来沟通的成本，让效率下降。亚马逊的Bezos有个逗趣的比喻，如果2个披萨不够一个团队吃的，那么这个团队就太大了。事实上一般一个互联网公司小产品的团队差不多就是7，8人左右（包含前后端测试交互用研等，可能身兼数职）。再对应下衡量微服务的标准，我们很容易会发现他们之间的密切关系： 分布式服务组成的系统 按照业务而不是技术来划分组织 做有生命的产品而不是项目 Smart endpoints and dumb pipes（我的理解是强服务个体和弱通信） 自动化运维（DevOps） 容错 快速演化 参考资料 远距离条件下的康威定律——分布式世界中实现团队构建，本文图片来源该ppt截图 Conway‘s Law in wiki Conway’s Law Homepage]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[记忆的分类 外显记忆（explicit memory）：需要可以努力去记忆。 内隐记忆（implicit memory）：不需要意识控制，也不需要意志努力。 程序性记忆（procedural memory）：一种关于怎么做事情的过程、步骤等具体操作的记忆。 陈述性记忆（declarative memory）：一种依靠语言描述来进行的记忆。如背单词。 情景记忆（episodic ）：对过去经验中时间、地点、过程等的记忆。 语义记忆（semantic memory）：对抽象语言符号的记忆。 容易忘记：语义记忆，外显记忆，陈述性记忆。难以忘记：情景记忆，程序性记忆，内隐记忆。 感觉记忆（0.5—4s）；短时记忆（5s—60s）：容易被打扰；长时记忆（大于60s） 三大学习方式 经典条件反射（classical conditional reflex）：巴普洛夫的狗。先有刺激再有反应。 操作性条件反射（operant conditioning reflex）：斯金纳的老鼠。先有反应再有刺激。即行为的结果，增加了行为的频率。 观察学习（observational learning）：班都拉提出来的。模仿，即看着看着就会了。譬如，谈恋爱。 你不知道的东西，潜意识知道意识和潜意识。通过梦、自由联想和催眠可以进入潜意识。弗洛伊德的精神分析基本假设认为人的行为是受到原始欲望所驱使的，所以归根到底人的行为是由本能驱动的。弗洛伊德人格结构理论： 本我（id）：原始冲动。按照快乐原则行事。 自我（ego）：人格中相对理性的一面，它协调者本我和外界之间的关系。以我按照现实原则行事。 超我（superego）：所有价值观的源泉，是我们后天慢慢习得的一种社会规范和道德。超我就是被内化的道德。按照道德原则行事。本我和超我常常有冲突。自我起到调节两者的作用。调节失败的话就有可能会人格分裂。自我通过部分第压抑本我的冲动，从而避免了和超我之间产生冲突。即自我开启了自我防御机制。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_6011d5ef0101rr0j.html 著名心理学家艾宾浩斯曾经说过，心理学有一个长期的过去，但是只有一个短暂的历史。 这句话是什么意思呢？也就是说我们人类对自己心理的关注其实是渊远流传，在我们中国文化里头，就有很多对心的分析、心的判断。洛阳亲友如相问、一片冰心在玉壶，讲得就是自己的心；知我者谓我心忧不知我者谓我何求，讲的也就是我们人类的需求。 人类的心理活动，甚至上升到了哲学的高度。在中国历史上有一个哲学流派叫心学，它的基本观点就是：世上无心外之物,世上无心外之理。 但是什么是心、心存在何处、心有什么样的表现，这样一个问题难住了人类的科学家几千年，那么心理学的历史到底从何算起呢？ 德国冯特创建第一个心理学实验室。1879年12月。用以研究人类意识活动的基本过程。 冯特不光创建了第一个心理学实验室，他还招收了很多优秀的学生，这些人都成为各个国家的心理学的领军人物，其中一个是铁钦纳。 铁钦纳作为冯特的学生，把心理学的实验传统带到了美国，创立完善了结构主义的心理学理论。(在康乃尔大学创建美国第一个心理学实验室)。 结构主义认为心理学应该研究人类的意识，而人类的意识就是由一块块意识的元素所组成，所以这就是像科学的结构主义理论一样，人类的心理活动也应该从元素研究开始。 斯坦利霍尔：儿童心理学运动之父和青春期发展理论家 心理学历史上还有一个非常重要的人物叫威廉•杰姆斯，他是公认的美国心理学的奠基者。 威廉杰姆斯：美国心理学的奠基者【机能主义】，信奉达尔文主义。认为意识就像一条生命的泉水，源源不断融入到我们的心中。创造了意识流的概念。心理学应该关注各种心理活动存在的原因意义和价值。认为人类的心理活动都是几千万年人类进化选择出来的心理特征和心理特质，这种特质都有它存在的意义。 威廉•杰姆斯是哈佛大学的心理学教授，他对意识问题也很关注，但他不同意冯特和铁钦纳的观点，他不认为意识只是一些毫无生命的简单的元素和方块，他觉得意识就像一条生命的泉水源源不断融入到我们的心中，所以他创造了一个概念叫意识流。 作为这个机能主义的奠基人，他觉得心理学家更应该关注各种心理活动它存在的原因意义和价值，他信奉达尔文主义，所以认为所有的人类的心理活动，都是几千万年人类进化选择出来的心理特征和心理特质，而这种心理特质都有它存在的意义，所以我们把以威廉•杰姆斯为首的心理学理论流派叫机能主义流派。 当机能主义在美国兴起的时候，在欧洲悄然兴起了另外一种心理学的研究理论流派，就是著名的弗洛伊德的精神分析理论。 弗洛尹德精神分析理论：人类的心理活动主要由无意识的心理活动引起，自由联想，反映心理下意识的欲望和需求。引用一些梦的分析来探索人类的内在的无意识的冲动【欧洲】 他引用一些梦的分析来探索人类的内在的、无意识的冲动，他也对生活中间人类的口误、人类的一些基本的错误感兴趣。一个学生迟到了，开口就说我恨不得还可以晚点再来，其实就反映了他内在的一些心理的冲动和欲望。 弗洛伊德是20世纪最有影响的心理学家，不光是对我们心理学影响很大，对人类的哲学、艺术、历史学、社会学、政治学都有非常大的影响，所以有人说弗洛伊德代表了心理学。 其实这是一种误解，我们现在的心理学，早已经发现弗洛伊德的很多观点和理论其实没有现代科学的证据，而且大部分的证据来自于对病人的分析，所以有很多以偏概全的倾向性。 弗洛伊德的主要理论包括冰山理论意识、潜意识理论、心理发展阶段理论、心理防御机制。 当弗洛伊德理论在欧洲大陆兴盛的时候，在美国出现了一种新的心理学理论流派叫做行为主义，其代表任务包括华生和斯金纳。 华生：认为心理学家应该更多的研究一些可以观察可以测量，可以定义的心理学变量【行为】。行为是人类外显的表现，可以做具体的观察，研究。是人类对外在刺激的一种自发的，自动的反应。行为是可以塑造可以改变的。“任何人如果给以足够的行为塑造，可以让它变成我们所期望的任何其他人” 行为主义的第二个代表人物叫斯金纳，他认为心理学家不应该花时间去研究不可捉摸的人类意识，我们应该去研究人类的行为，人类行为都是可以通过操作性条件反射加以塑造、加以改变的。 斯金纳的行为主义，对人类的学习、记忆、教育研究都有很大的促进作用，但他的很多观点、已经过时，因为我们现代心理学发现，人类的思维一定是我们心理活动非常重要的一个方面，我们不可能把人类的思维、意识排除在心理学研究的范围之外。 在谈到行为主义的时候，我们就不得不介绍一个做出了世界性贡献的中国人，他就是著名的行为主义心理学家郭任远先生。《向本能主义说不》第一次提出来本能的研究，在很大程度上都是循环论证，应该用行为的研究来分析，人类的心理活动。 无论是弗洛伊德的精神分析理论，还是行为主义的基本理论，都有很大程度的宿命论的意思，放弃了人类的主观的主动精神和自由意志，所以有些心理学家认为我们心理学应该具有更大的人文的精神、人文的情怀。两个代表人物，一个叫罗杰斯，一个叫马斯洛，他们认为我们人类应该有更高级的追求，我们不是简单的对外在环境做出反应、做出适应、做出调整。 马斯洛是一个著名的人文主义的心理学家，他的基本理论就是认为人类有很多的需求，有些需求是我们基本的生存需求，但是人类也有很多更高级的追求，在基本需求满足以后，我们人类一定会追求高级的心理需求。马斯洛的需求层次理论到底有哪些具体内容呢？ 下面我们看一看马斯洛需求层次结构： 生理的需求physiological needs【本能层次的需要，包括食欲，睡眠，欲望等】；安全的需求security needs【避免对生命构成威胁的需要】；社交的需求social needs【社会需要，包括对友谊，爱情以及隶属关系的需求】；尊重的需求esteemneeds【想被人承认的需要】；自我实现的需求sell-actualization needs【对理想实现，发挥最大潜能的需要；最高境界，人的潜能和理想的最大化】 马斯洛的需求层次的最高境界就是自我实现，指的是人的潜能和理想的最大化，那么这种自我实现在我们中国文化环境下可能是另外一种境界。 台湾中央研究院的著名心理学家杨国枢先生，就认为我们中国人的自我，其实是国家、家庭和个人的三位一体，是一种整体性的、集体的自我实现。这种自我实现是我们人类追求的最高的境界。 到底什么样的人能够达到自我实现的境界呢？马斯洛通过对林肯、斯宾诺莎和他周围的很多成功人士的分析和调查总结出来自我实现的人应该具备的一些心理特质。 这些特质包括： 全面准确的知觉现实 接纳自己与他人 对人自发坦率和真实 以问题为中心而不是以自我为中心 具有超然于世和独处的需求 具有自主性在环境和文化中能保持相对独立性 具有永不衰退的鉴赏力 具有难以形容的高峰体验 对人充满爱心 具有深厚的友情 具备民主精神 区分手段和目的 富于创造性 处事幽默风趣 反对盲目遵从 为什么心理学有这么多的流派、有这么多的不同的看法和争论，其实它核心的问题就是心理的复杂、心理活动的不可捉摸和心理研究的巨大的挑战。 心理学和其他任何人类科学一样，都是需要通过不断的发展、不断的升华、不断的总结，真正的掌握我们科学的基本规律。在很多情况下，不同的学派其实是抓住了心理活动的不同的侧面，就像盲人摸象一样，每一个盲人其实只是接触了象的某一个部分、某一个部位、某一种角度，我们心理学的各种流派也是抓住了人类心理活动的不同的角度，不同的方向、不同的方面，整合起来就形成了一个对人心的基本认识基本判断。 那么心理学未来如何去发展呢，现在看来起码有三大研究领域会产生引人入胜的层出不穷的新的研究、新的发现，我个人认为这三大领域，也许能够代表人类心理学未来的研究重点、研究突破和研究方向。 第一个领域就是认知神经领域，它是七十年代兴起的认知革命的延续，它借用了生物科学的一些全新的技术，特别是核磁共振技术来研究人类心理活动的脑机制。看一看我们的心理活动，是不是受到了人脑的生物的具体的局限，它的脑区的范围在什么地方，表现又有如何，这些脑科学的革命，对人类的认知科学有巨大的促进作用。认知革命发源于七十年代，主要是用计算机信息技术来分析，了解人类的心理活动的普遍规律，它的一个核心思想，就是我们人脑它是一个黑箱，我们很难知道这个黑箱的具体运作，通过对我们的输入和输出的分析，我们可以推测黑箱的基本运作和基本的研究范式，认知革命借助神经科学技术，它现在正在进行，我们在未来的心理学概论课中会介绍认知的一些新的发现、新的突破和新的证据。 心理学第二个非常重要的革命，我个人认为是文化革命。在九十年代，美国心理学家开始意识到不是所有人都说英文，不是所有的人都有美国人那样特殊的心理的表现，这些心理学家认为我们应该从社会文化的角度，分析探索人类心理活动的基本规律。文化心理学研究领域的一个著名的代表人物，就是我的导师理查德.尼斯贝特，美国密西根大学心理学的终身教授和美国科学院和文学院双料院士，他和我以及其他同事做了很多文化差异的基本研究，发现东方人和西方人在思维、判断、情绪、认识等各个方面都有非常大的差异。 其中一个有趣的研究就是让来自世界不同地方的人观察一下鱼缸的活动。下面就请看我当年在美国密西根大学做博士论文时候完成的一个跨文化的比较。 心理学的未来研究发展值得关注的第三个方向，我个人认为是九十年代末期兴起的积极心理学，积极心理学奠基人马丁•塞利格曼和奇克森特米海伊，他们认为心理学家应该多多关注人类的优点、美德和最佳行为，人类的优势其实是多方面的，我们不光有思维的优势，我们也有情感的优势，我们也有道德的优势，我们还有创造的优势，我们人有追求、有理想，我们人也有同情心、利他心，人不光是一个生物的动物，也是一个社会的动物，更是一个道德的动物。 积极心理学是我们心理学未来发展，非常有前途、有希望的学科，因为我们心理学家是关心人类、共情人类、支持人类，也是希望能够理解人类的学科。 心理学是一个通人心 、接地气、有追求的、伟大的科学，心理学的历史就是不断升华自己 、提升自己、创造新的自己的一个历史。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[奇异集团前总裁 杰克‧威尔许: 我把六、七成时间都花费在「人」身上， 但还是有百分之二十五的机率， 会看走眼、用错人。 《FBI教你读心术》运用发表.pptx 真正的吃惊表情转瞬即逝，超过一秒钟便是假装的; 撒谎者不像惯常理解的那样会回避对方的眼神，反而更需要眼神交流来判断你是否相信他说的话; “你去过她家吗?”“不，我没有去过她家”，对问题的生硬重复是典型的撒谎; 男性鼻子下方有海绵体，摸鼻子代表想要掩饰某些内容; 手放在眉骨附近表示羞愧; 描述一连串发生的事情，编造都是按时间顺序进行的，能否流利准确地进行倒叙是判断对方是否说谎的标准之一; 叙事时眼球向左下方看，这代表大脑在回忆，所说的是真话;而谎言不需要回忆的过程 说话时单肩耸动，表示对所说的话极不自信，是说谎的表现; 人在害怕时会出现生理逃跑反应———血液从四肢回流到腿部(做好逃跑准备)，因此手的体表温度会下降; 明知故问的时候眉毛微微上扬; 如果对方对你的质问表示不屑，通常你的质问会是真的; 假笑眼角是没有皱纹的。 当面部表情两边不对称的时候，极有可能他们的表情是装出来的; 摩挲自己的手，是一种自我安慰的表现。当你不相信你自己所说的话，这样使自己安心; 抿嘴两次，典型的模棱两可; 双手抱胸、退一步——肢体 抗 议，说明他的话不可信; 虚情假意不会有眨眼。 纵火案犯与强 奸犯在动机上有着惊人的相似性。记住两点，生活会更简单—— 重要的不是他是否撒谎，而是为什么要撒谎。 真相和快乐不可兼得。 说谎者在说谎前会眼神飘移 在想好说什么谎后 会眼神肯定 如果你冷静的反驳 说谎者会再次出现眼神飘移。 撒谎者面对一个提问，通常会先有点失措，然后借假笑的时间迅速思考，想出一个并不高明的谎言，然后异常坚定地回应。而且，会一直自言自语，越说越多，因为沉默的时候，他觉得别人还在怀疑他。 第一集： 倒叙法：先说正叙，后说倒叙。测试说谎 眼睛法：看着你有可能是在说谎，想看看你是否相信这个谎言。看左边，回忆，真话。 要三个人保持秘密的方法就是，其中两个人死了。 心生恐惧，典型的生理逃跑反应，血液从四肢回流到腿部做好逃跑准备，他的手部首先冰凉。 你去过她家吗?不，我没有去过她家。 这样生硬的重复是典型的谎言。 真相和快乐不可兼得。 说话时单肩耸动，表示对所说的话极不自信，身体和语言的不一致，表明在说谎。 如果吃惊的表情维持超过1秒，那就是在装，说明他在说谎。真正的吃惊表情转瞬即逝。 眨眼睛就是真情 瞳孔放大代表有性欲 哈哈 男人摸鼻子代表想要掩饰 手放在眉骨附近代表羞愧 如果眉毛向下紧，那是真惊讶，如果眉毛上抬，表示其实知道而且在说谎 第二集： 说话时倒退一步，代表对自己所说的观点没有信心。 人们说谎的时候会摸脖子，这是个经典的动作。 纵火和强奸有非常大的相关性，它们都是为了自我证明而出现的犯罪行为。 对人说话时向前伸下巴，代表生气或者愤怒。 语速快，将物体放在胸前，使自己与人竖起一道屏障，这是焦虑的表现。 如果可以，选择观察，让别人来问问题，这样能更好地观察而避免分心。 没有预谋、只有一次、并且无其他暴力行为的强奸行为，一般都是罪犯为了证明自己力量的男性主义崇尚者。 叙述者做出撇嘴的动作(嘴角两边向下，成一个凸行的弧度)，这是一个经典的泄露内心的表情，就是对自己所说的话没有信心，或者有撒谎的嫌疑。mouth shrug\hands shrug 不要让事实妨碍真相。(这句话同第一集的那句“真相和快乐不可兼得”一样，太精辟了) 说话时手掌向外一翻一翻的，代表没有信心或者编造故事。 吃安定可以减少情绪起伏额 女性如果看到同胞说自己被强奸而无动于衷的话，那说明她们知道这是在说谎，这个根本没有发生。 第三集: 话语重复，并且声音上扬——撒谎 在学校里，越受欢迎的孩子，越会撒谎，他们能说会道，隐藏自己的感情。研究by福斯特 当人的脸部表情两边不对称的时候，极有可能他们表现出来的感情是装出来的。 对自己描述的情况，会出现某些细节遗忘，但能进行及时纠正，很有可能不是在撒谎。如：回忆高度时把100000英尺改为100500英尺。 说话缓慢轻柔表明内心极度的悲伤和焦虑。 如果没有合适的问题，就不可能得到正确的答案。(同上一集的不要让事实妨碍真相，呵呵。)其实还有一句，既是在说假话，又不是在撒谎，那就是当不知道自己说的是假话。 摩挲自己的双手——自我安慰的状态，当你不相信自己在说什么的时候，就会出现这个动作来使自己安心。 如果先突然大声说话，然后再用手猛拍桌子，这是对可怕事情反应的手势时间差。如果是真的发火，这两个动作会同时进行。 在刑事案件中，只有清白的人才敢承认自己和死者有过争执。罪犯是不会承认任何事情的，并且表面上会装得很无辜。 当真正的凶手看到被害者照片的时候，会表现出恶心、轻蔑甚至是害怕。但绝对不会是吃惊。 第四集： 要是有人要将要实施血腥的罪行，就会出现这样的表情：眉毛朝下皱紧，上眼睑扬起，眼周绷紧。 (微)表情是无意识的，不是通过选择而做出的，因此是控制不了的。并且和国籍没有关系。 几乎所有的婚礼上，都交织着香槟和怨恨。 眉毛上扬并挤在一起，那是害怕担忧和恐惧。 说话时眨眼睛——隐瞒了什么。 说话犹豫且重复，没有办法组织好自己该说的话，所以明显是在说谎。 手指指向一边，眼睛却朝另一边看，说谎的时候就会这样，绞尽脑汁编造事实，肢体则完全跟不上。 亮出中指(fuck的手势)，这是象征性的还有特定意识的下意识手势，充满敌意。 第五集： 被询问时，咬嘴唇、抓耳朵，这是在提高自己的控制感——焦虑的表现。 如果事先已经准备好了谎言，会强烈希望快点把谎话说完。也就是反应时差(提问和回答之间的停顿时间)很短很短，甚至不足一秒。 在痛苦的尽头，总是有欢笑。——拉蒙 德 卡波莫 鼻孔扩大、嘴唇绷紧——发火了，但还在控制当中。 叙述时低着头并且抚摸自己的额头，这是羞愧的表现。 脸颊升高，嘴角下撇，这是悔恨的表现。 适不适合并不是最关键的，关键在于适应改变的能力。达尔文 轻微的摇头表示“不”，当我们在说“yes”的时候却言不由衷，就会不小心做这个动作。 眉毛挑起、皱到一起——害怕。 第六集： 问最关键的问题，而且是在当事人毫无准备的情况下，往往可以得出毫无粉饰的表情，我叫它原生态表情，hoho~ 试探一个人是不是说谎，最简单并且最邪恶的办法就是也扯个谎让他往里跳。 咧嘴并且嘴角向下：这下玩儿完了。 说话之后手紧握椅子扶手，对自己的表述不认可。 抿嘴，试图掩盖。 自我阉割的恋童癖者说实话……(这条实用性不大) 吞咽表示强烈的情感。 摸自己的脸颊靠近耳根部位，紧张。 第七集： 在进行类似指纹调查时，只有罪犯，才会知道指纹不是他们自己的。 在中东，出场顺序是很讲究的。最重要的人往往最后一个入场。 “……，我只会说一次!”——经典的强势表述，如果说的是真话，就不需要这样。 显然，科学和商业无法融合。 “To my knowledge…”，“就我所知……”——这样的开头，也许意味着事实上知道些什么，从另一个角度上来说，也许坦白一切了已经。 回答问题时咬紧嘴唇，这是焦虑的体现。 侦破谎言的关键在于，问对问题。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[麦肯锡方法]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-04-27-Book-McKinseyWorkingMethod%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[第一部分：麦肯锡思考企业问题的方法一、建立解决方案 以事实为基础：对收集事实的积极态度，必须不害怕、不逃避事实 严格的结构化：MECE原则（相互独立、完全穷尽）。对事件细节的归类一般可以分为三种，或者加一个其他类。这三种分类必须相互独立没有交集，且每一个分类能完全穷尽其范围内的细节（可再下列其他分支） 以假设为导向 定义最初的假设：在你找出问题之前想出来的解决方案（有待证明或驳斥，并非答案）创造最初的假设：用一两个小时翻这个行业的出版物（不是为了了解事实，而是吸收这个行业的气息），或者最好找到了解这一行业的人。根据“关键驱动因素”原则建立框架（一、二、三），并进一步建立“问题树模型”。检验最初的假设：考虑客户情况，是否是最佳假设？是否已经涵盖所有问题？是否已经考虑到了关于这个问题的搜有关键驱动因素？建议方案是否都是可行的、可证明的。 二、制定计划 问题不会永远是问题：深入的挖掘收集事实，搞清楚交给你的问题是不是真正的问题。找出真正决定性问题所在 不要去重新发明解决问题的工具：增值分析、商业流程分析、重建商业流程（BPR）、产品-市场扫描等等。分析框架对于战略性的商业分析具有强大的启动作用。 不存在统一的解决方案：相似的商业问题不意味着有相似的解决方案。即使你最初的经验假设可能是正确的，也要用足够事实去证明你最初的猜想。 不要让事实去适应你的解决方法：保持开放而富有弹性的思维，不要让强有力的假设变成头脑僵化的借口。从连续不断的事实收集和分析中停下来，问一问自己过去一个礼拜（或一个月）你已经获取的新信息与你最初的假设是否自恰？如果不自恰，应当适当改变假设。 确保你的解决方法适合你的客户：即便再完美的方案，如果客户无法实施，也是徒劳无益的。了解客户管理层的优势、劣势、能力——什么是管理层做不到的。根据这些来剪裁你的最终方案。常见的局限条件是：政治原因、缺乏资源、能力有限。 有时候要让解决方案来找你：最初假设只是有助与你组织和深化你的思维，只有足够的事实和创造性思维结合，新的假设和解决方案才会出现。 在实际调研和方案产生过程中遇到客户内部阻力怎么办： 重新定义问题：发现A问题角力会浪费大量精力与资源且有很大阻力时，及早的提出问题不是A，而是B。要表现出出色的商业判断力，而不是成为一个不及时的逃避问题者。锲而不舍的实施你的解决方案：不改变绝佳的解决方案，而是把方案实施时间拉长，等人事阻力离开企业后再实施方案达到最佳方案。解决政治问题:商业政治的本质是人们按照自己的利益行事，最终方案要考虑对客户内部政治群体的不同激励因素和整体组织因素。记住政治是可能性艺术，客户拒绝的理想方案就是无用方案。 三、80/20和其他一些重要规则 80/20规则：很多时候，这个法则是解决问题的启动点。 不要想把整个海洋煮沸:不要试图分析所有事情，要有所选择，找出应该做的事情的优先顺序。 发现关键驱动因素:把精力放在最重要的因素上（是什么影响了你的企业？），注意避免“计算平局率（即问题中每一个增加的方程，要求系统的计算量增加至少是方程数的平方）”。 电梯测试:如果你对你的解决方案足够了解，那么30秒内你就能清晰的把问题解释清楚（30秒电梯内和客户沟通的时间）。盯住三个最重要的建议（并且用数字和关键词说明），别去担心支持材料，等有时间再去说支持材料。 先摘好摘的果子:学会重视部分问题的解决和阶段性的成果。将能1，使客户更加热情和信任2，让客户即时的利润提高或效率提升3，鼓舞团队士气 每天制作一个图表:做好良好的时间规划和一天总结。静坐半小时问自己今天学到的三件最重要的事情是什么？制作成简易的三行两列表格，进入分析模式，想一想他们有没有意义，可以用在你的解决方案的什么地方。 一个垒一个垒的打:你不可能把一切事情都做完，即时你设法做到了一次反而会引起周围人对你不切实际的期望，一旦你没有满足这种期望，要想重新赢得信任的困难的。不要期许再商业上总出现本垒打，你最好一个垒一个垒的打。 要关注大画面:时不时的从正在做的事情中抬头想一想，正在做的事情对解决问题究竟如何？它是如何推进你的思路的？这是不是你应该做的最重要的事情？如果它对整件事没有什么帮助，你为什么要去做呢？ 只管说“我不知道”:没有什么把握的事情，只管说我不知道，不要信口开河试图蒙混过去。 不要接受“我没有什么概念”:你客户的“我没有什么概念”的意思是“我太忙了，没时间考虑这个问题”。你不能轻易接受这句话，刨根问底，问及细节或者让客户估计状况，这都能让你更接近精确的商业决策。 第二部分：解决企业问题的麦肯锡工作法四、推销研究 如何在没有推销的情况下销售:做到“市场营销”而不是“推销”。直接招揽生意会有失专业身份。利用出版物（免费的麦肯锡季刊或者丛书寄送给客户）。利用Alumini网络。与潜在用户保持非正式接触的庞大关系网（如参与慈善团体、文化组织这些业余活动）。通过一切正式或非正式得场合让你的潜在客户知道你。 小心自己的承诺:构造项目:DSC（客户服务主管）、优秀的项目经理应该做到把团队的能力和客户要求平衡到精确的程度：告诉客户“我们要做甲和乙这两件事情，我们可以做丙事情，但是那会把团队累垮。”对团队说“我们已经向客户保证要做丙事情，所有要说到做到”。这样团队能发挥到极致，客户又能觉得花费物有所值且超出自己的期望。 五、组成团队 获取综合的正确性:两种团队选择理论：1，智力决定一切。2，特殊的经验和技能。 有一点Team bonding活动能走的更长远的:不需要太多的活动，比如去当地最好的酒店，看演出，玩游戏。试着把团队成员的另一半叫上，有助于他们理解他们所爱的人及同事在干什么，也有助于你理解你的同事。 把握团队温度以保持士气:把握团队温度：保证他们乐于正在做的事情，注意发现他们对正在做的事情那个有没什么疑问，如果发现不妥，赶紧安排安抚措施。让你的团队明白他们要干的事情是什么：让他们知道他们做的事情对一个整体的重要性和对客户的价值创造，“毫无价值的事情”会让团队士气低落。以尊重对待你的团队同事：尊重他人和你有不一样的优先考虑，己所不欲，勿施于人。了解你的同事：他结婚了吗？有孩子吗？爱好是什么？这都有助于你理解他们。当日子不好过的时候：除了告诉队友“我能感觉你们大家的痛苦”之外，你能做的也就是不屈不挠的坚持下去，这就是生活，保持士气，至少保证项目结束大家不会想辞职。 六、处理好等级结构 让你的上司脸上有光:兴许整个公司里见到你最多的人就是你上司，所以最佳方法就是让她高兴一点，脸上有光：首先意味着尽最大能力做好工作，其次保证你知道的一切你的上司也知道，一定要让信息顺畅，让他知道你在哪在干什么会有什么问题。于此同时，又能用结构清晰的语音邮件和电子邮件来传递必要信息。 处理好登记层次的进取策略:你可以越级传递信息（但是会比较冒险），在一个等级僵化的组织里，最好请示上司还不是直接传递信息。 七、做研究 不要去重新发明轮子:也许你面临的问题，正是公司别的部门或者其他公司的人已经解决过的问题，善于节省时间和精力，不要重新发明轮子。除了行业杂志、报纸、资料库、数据库以外，行业人士常去的咖啡馆也是获取信息之处。 特殊的研究秘诀:从Annual report入手：拿到一个公司的年报时，首先要看的是“股东信息”或“董事长评论”，用略带怀疑的眼光去看，能看到上年度业绩，管理层未来发展战略。然后迅速浏览鬼獒价格、收益、EPS等关键财务指标，同时还能了解到经营单位、生产线信息、高管、办公设置及地点，接着你就可以钻研这些数字了。找出暴露出来的东西：找出特别好和特别差的方面，用计算机勾勒出一幅图画。比如把每一个销售人员的业绩输入表格，看看最好的和最差的数据，搞清楚出现这些的原因，你的研究就开始大踏步前进。找出最佳经验：找出这个行业中业绩最佳者，然后去模仿他们，往往是对付业绩不佳的速效药。找不到竞争对手的资料，可以去找供应商、消费者、华尔街上的分析师、行业的朋友、商学院的朋友在公司内部，找到业绩最佳的个人和团队，也能学到最佳经验。 八、进行走访走访是弥补书本信息不足的最佳方法。这些人拥有你想要的信息：客户公司的主管、生产线上的监工、供应商、顾客、行业专家、竞争对手等等。 做好准备：写出走访提纲可能你只有30分钟时间和一个你再也不会见到的人呆在一起，因此要想清楚你要提出的问题。首先把需要答案的问题列出来，先不管顺序。其次更为重要的是，你真正需要的是什么？你想达到的目的是什么？为什么要走访这个人？把目的定义清楚会有助于你按正确的顺序提问。要了解走访对象的性格，并且从热身问题问起（比如行业的看法，对对方的赞许和寒暄）。在问题中嵌入一些事实上你知道答案的问题，用以洞察被访者的诚实程度和知识面，对于一些复杂的问题，可能不止一个答案，你要问的详尽。在提纲写出来之后，你还要仔细想想你最想了解的是哪三个问题。在访问结束之前，记得问“麦肯锡原始问题”：你还有没什么想要告诉我。访问部门主管的好处是：他了解高层不愿意谈的问题（谁可以推动哪个部门、问题的症结在哪里等） 在走访过程中，注意聆听和引导让被访者清楚你正在听（插入对、我明白、唔-唔之类的语言，肢体语言比如身体靠近，点头，做笔记（即时他在说废话））。有时候，静默不说话反而能让对方讲更多信息。 走访成功的7个秘诀让被访者的上司安排会面：当被上级告知这次走访很重要时，他才不会东拉西扯不着重点。两个人一起进行走访：轮流提问和做笔记，有一个对行业了解的人更加。倾听，不要指导：不要问选择题，问问答题。这样你才能获取更多信息。复述，复述，复述：很多被访者的言语并不十分有逻辑，这时候你需要用你理解的答案复述给他听，询问是否正确的理解了他的信息，同时给他补充信息和强调重点的机会。采用旁敲侧击的方式：或许直接提问会惹怒被访者，注意照顾被访者的情感和必要兜圈子、旁敲侧击。不要问太多：关于行业的信息你从行业报告和网络都能获得，没必要什么都问他，集中问题在你想了解的几个最重要方面。不要穷追不舍，让对方产生不舒适则更难得到有效信息。采用考伦波策略（来源于70年代电视剧）：即在离开的门口转身提问。要是你需要得到某个特殊问题的答案，或者一份特殊数据。一旦走访结束，每个人都会放松下来，他的压迫感会消失，提放心理大大下降。这时候往往会告诉你你费心寻找的信息。“超级”考伦波策略：等过了一两天后，只不过顺便路过被访者办公室，记起了一个你忘记问的问题，这样显得你没有威胁性，更容易得到信息。 不要让被访者无处躲藏因为你代表一部分客户高层的“权利”，所以不要让中层被访者觉得自己在被审问，而担心自己丢掉职位，你要指出不光是对他访问，还包括整个企业提高效益，如果你能告诉他你能为他提高工作效率，提高他雇员的盈利能力，和他共享整个企业的信息，访问能顺利进行。 困难的走访记住授权给你的人的级别。如果遇到有敌意的不愿意提供信息的人，你可以施展“职权”或者必要的时候当场给他的上司打电话。对付喋喋不休者，除了旁敲侧击，也许最好的方法就是找一个别的知道这个事情的人访问。如果你要访问的人是这样一个人，即你的调研会让他丢掉工作，而你和他都深知这一点，这种情况下你除了尽职尽责、完全公正，不生气急躁也不情绪低落，你没有别的办法。内心平静的完成工作，记住，没有人说生活是公平的。 一定要写感谢信在和人谈话完毕后，回去记得花时间写感谢信，不但有礼貌而且很职业，且会在今后的合作给你带来意想不到的回报。 九、头脑风暴 预先准备的力量 在头脑风暴之前，要把你整理到事实要点整理成清晰的提要，分发给每一个成员阅读，这样产生思想的时候，你们有了同样的知识基础。比较好的态度是：“我认为情况可能是这样的，大家一起来推敲一下这个假设。”当然，在事先准备上，你不止需要准备一个假设，在讨论的时候一些不适用的假设可以被迅速排除，而有可能性的假设你要让团队是自由发挥。无论如何得一点是，最低限度为：你要了解事实。 在一干二净的屋子里进行记住，进入房间里应该有空白的白板。其他应该遵循的准则如下：没有坏主意：不要让大家恐惧自己会提出“坏主意”，应该鼓励每个人积极表达自己的想法。没有不值得回答的问题：不要以为什么常识都是理所当然的，任何一个简单常识刨根问底下去都可能得到非常有益的启示。准备好扼杀自己的婴儿：如果你的主意从头到尾没有被作为问题或答案的一部分，那么忍痛割爱吧，或者事后提出。不要带着誓死捍卫的情绪去参加会议。知道什么时候说什么话：在气氛转变之前，团队可以忍受的头脑风暴的时间是两个小时，即时的停止防止团队疲惫、迟钝及情绪暴躁。如果必须全天开会，那么做好后勤保障，可以允许跑题开玩笑，但片刻后要调动大家保持注意力，会议中提供半小时的休息，出去一会是整理思维舒展筋骨的好机会。 好记性不如烂笔头任何奇思妙想会在你肾上腺素用完、疲惫降临的时候彻底忘却。麦肯锡使用一种可以备份白板笔记的白板，当然你可以让用技术含量低的便签纸复制内容（切记要整齐），会议结束派专人吧便签纸内容誊写在普通纸上给团队成员传阅。 头脑风暴练习公布式的练习：给会议室每个人一沓自粘式的便签条，让与会者把任何相关的主意都写下来，每个主意写一张条子，一起交给负责人，由负责人大声读出来，这样能很快形成大量不错的主意且避免每一个主意都接着纠缠不休的讨论。 文件夹练习：在办公室摆上许多夹子（每个之上标上不同分类和问题），让团队成员把自己的主意写在相应的夹子里（每个人笔颜色不一样，这样能分辨是谁的主意） 在紧张气氛中处理大规模头脑风暴的方法：首先要求客户对象把已有方案中不喜欢的一切内容讲出来，等他们发泄完了，让他们提出哪些做得比较好的方面，以及哪些可能在他们企业部门实施。这样一是可能产生之前没有想到的好方案，二是有助于哪些先前怀疑态度者接受麦肯锡的解决方法。 还有一个对付爱在头脑风暴上煽风点火或者发牢骚的人的办法，让负责人站在他背后，有时甚至去触碰它的肩膀。暗示他他正在受到关注，如果他还在喋喋不休，负责人可以提示他为什么不大声讲出来给大家听呢。 第三部分：麦肯锡推销解决方案的方法十、情况介绍麦肯锡情况介绍的一般形式：会议室里采用装订精美的蓝皮工作簿，非正式小会谈则是一叠图表订成的卡片 结构化麦肯锡的方法是我们最前面提到的MECE原则。当然这如果不符合你的思维习惯，你也可以采用别的结构，比如：“告诉人们你打算告诉他们的内容，把你已经告诉他们的内容一再的讲给他们听”。 记住努力的边际效用是递减的掂量一下最后24小时，是让你的团队睡个好觉更重要，还是修改一些情况说明重新装订成册更重要。不要让最佳方案成为优先方案的对立面。修改也要有原则，最终展示前的24小时，打印、装订、制作PPT这些工作必须已经完成。这24小时应该尽可能的预言，讨论客户可能会提出的的问题，哪怕是在办公室休息一天也好。如果你的上级对文件有最后发言权，那么提前48小时给他审批。 预先准备好一切一次好的present不应当包含对客户而言一无所知的事情。把所有部门负责人召集来之前应该让他们过目一遍你的发现（提前每个部门单独访问的目的是：了解一些你可能忽略的问题，防止在最后present上提出的方案对一些部门不利，引起这些部门负责人的暴怒，至少他们有了心理准备） 十一、用图表表示数据（注：这一部分可参考麦肯锡的一书） 简单明了：每张图表应该只包含一个信息禁止使用分散注意力的色彩，用尽量少的单色来制作图表（网上有麦肯锡的PPT模板），如非必要不用三维图，坚持每张图表只包含一种信息，标题简单明了，需要特别注意的点用底纹、爆炸型的扇形区域或者大箭头来突出信息。如果同样一幅图有多个重点，则复制一次图表，在下一页再重新标明新的重点。一个大章节控制在10页PPT以下。 运用瀑布图展示信息书中不够详尽，具体学习可参考：http://excelpro. blog. sohu. com/84903213. html 十二、管理好内部沟通 让信息流动起来内部交流的方式有：消息（声音邮件、电子邮件、备忘录等）和会议以及随机交流（四处走走，走廊里、饮水机旁、吃午饭的路上）。会议是团队的凝固剂，不光提供信息流动的机会，而且提醒出席会议的人“他们是团队的组成部分”，为了保证团队里每个人到场，将会议作为日程的固定项目，当然如果没有事情要谈，放45分钟假也是好选择。会议成功的关键：议程（保持在所需的最低数量）和领导（保持议程精练，频繁开会总比开长会要好）。 有效信息的三个关键信息交流的方式以上已经讲了，要注意三个特征：简洁：张口说话把信息量缩减到3，4点，如有必要可以用纸列出要点。完整：不但要说自己正在干什么，还要回报到底是怎么一回事以及你对这件事情的看法。结构：用MECE吧。但是别给你女朋友发信息也遵循MECE原则。 凡事留神不要在公众场合拿出客户资料开始工作，不在办公室外提及客户的名字，在讨论客户时，使用代码，不要乱扔文件，即时上锁。 十三、与客户一道工作 让客户站在你的一边保证大家绑在一起的关键是：把他们的目标转换为我们的目标，任何一方的失败都意味着另外一方的失败。还有，让客户意识到与麦肯锡一道工作是一段有意义的经历，至少他们都学到很多其他地方学不到的东西，这对他的职业生涯大有裨益，甚至有机会在企业里实现大的变革。和客户一起去球场或者好的餐馆吃饭吧（这样人们都放下了“办公室面孔”）。 如何与客户团队中的“讨债鬼”打交道客户里的“讨债鬼”就是没有什么用处的人以及有意作对的人，工作时尽量绕开他们。对于消极怠工的没用处的人，给他一些单独的工作让他去做，保证这不是什么关键的部分。而有意作对的人，他可能是公司有权势的人派来的，尽量不要让敏感信息落入他手，设法了解他的幕后指挥者的意图（最后方案里也可利用这一意图）。最后，如果可能的花，团结没有什么作用的人，让他理解并接受我们的解决方案，不要和我们作对。 让客户参与过程让客户参与的第一步就是理解他们的打算和意图，只有他们觉得你的努力有助于他们的利益时，他们才会支持你。记住，他们的利益是会随着时间变化的，所以经常的联系和更新很重要，按照客户预定的时间表工作，试探着安排会议议题。参加第三章，阶段性的胜利和成果会让他们热情更大，客户参与达成解决方案的过程（且他们也理解这个方案）远比把解决方案装订整齐扎上漂亮的丝带有效的多。即时你的工作量再多，实际上你让客户能觉得这是他们自己的解决方案或者模型的话，不是什么坏事。 让整个企业接受为了避免方案最后被束之高阁。不要以为把方案提交给董事会通过就万事大吉了，还要提交给中层管理者以及生产线上的工人（他们是否接受方案对真正实施至关重要）。记得把你的方案剪裁的适合你的听众（别对司机和首席执行官都是讲一个东西），一是要展现整个画面，二是把干什么，为什么这么干讲清楚，尊重他们。 严格实施在每一个小项目之后用括号写上项目日期及负责人。按照实施计划把详尽安排分配给每一个人，每一个短周期开一个会，任何没有完成任务的人必须在全组面前解释为什么没有完成任务。 第四部分：在麦肯锡生存十四、找到自己的师傅Mentor能为你指导工作并指导职业生涯的规划。这一点，对任何组织都适用。 十五、生存在路上全国或者全球旅行好耗费你很多精力，把旅行当做是探险会减轻你的负担，恰当的计划和心态也很重要。利用出差去稍微旅游半天一天放松自己，旅行时你做你经历以外的事情的机会。安排好访问客户的时间，保证你周一或者周五是在家里的（多休息一天嘛），如果可能的话尽量只带一个手提包，别托运行李了。事先知道可靠的出租车公司。如果需要长期在外，就去找找当地的团队成员、大学同学，大家一起吃个饭或者看演出、球赛。实在不行就在房间里读书看电视也行，不要把旅程变成不舒适的“工作、吃饭、睡觉”。另外一个有趣的建议是：尊重空乘人员，他们能给你多一个毛毯或者别的帮助。 十六、无论去哪里都带上这三件东西出外旅行的三样东西：PTM（passport，ticket，money）。另外三件是：旅行计划的copy，每一个要见的人的名字和联系方式、一本好书。服装：多带一件衬衫或者一条裤子；男士多带两条领带；女士多带一双舒适的平底鞋；休闲装；运动装（防止你的健康状况下降）；一件毛衣（飞机上能保暖）工具：便签纸；方格纸（用于画图）；你送给客户的任何东西的复本；金融计算器（你会容易忘记，但他比瑞士军刀还管用）个人用品：牙刷；男士刮胡刀；女士小化妆包；抗酸剂药片（用于治疗胃、十二指肠溃疡和胃酸分泌过多症）；一瓶泰诺；一大瓶泰诺（健康状况下降很容易感冒）与你单位保持联系的物品：个人记事本；信用卡（单独放在皮夹子里也不错）；航班时刻表；移动电话（忘了什么，可以让他们传给你就近的传真机）；客户的地址和路线图娱乐用品：一本好书；飞机上阅读的剪报；mp3；在laptop上玩的游戏如果你在一些诡异的国家工作，比如巴西，那么：雨伞、太阳镜、避孕套。 十七、好助手是你的生命线秘书为你记录口信、安排日程、打字、复印、整理文件、后方援助等等，所以对她好一点、关心她的成长、对她问有所答。实际上为了留住好的秘书，麦肯锡负责行政和招聘的很多管理人员都是从秘书起步的。 十八、麦肯锡的招聘风格麦肯锡寻找的是名牌商学院、法学院、经济学以及金融学研究生项目培养出来的尖子中的尖子。当然，医生、科学家、政界人事也是商学领域之外的人才。麦肯锡会用一流的酒店和餐馆来吸引人才。麦肯锡用案例来寻找具有分析思考能力的人（他们可以把问题分解成其组成部分，找到组织起来的证据，有商业判断能力、明白自己解决方案的含义）。面试的时候带上计算器，如让你估算全美国有多少加油站，考察的不是这个结果，而是你得出数字的方法（比如知道全美国人口——每个家庭平均人口2. 5个——平均每个家庭拥有1. 8辆车——全美的汽车数量再爱估算需要多少加油站）。 麦肯锡都是绝顶聪明的人，但是反对那些绝顶聪明又难以相处的人加入。另外，面试时你的陈述（准备好的材料简历）会被随时打断。毫无疑问，进入麦肯锡的条件是：智力比平均值高一点，具有好大学和名牌商学院的成绩单，展示过去所有工作中取得成绩的证据、证明自己具有非同一般的分析能力。准备案例是很重要的，处理复杂问题时不会顿住，而是能越挖越深的人是麦肯锡想要的人。 十九、如果你还想要自己的生活的话，那就要定一些规则因为你一周工作80小时甚至更多，除了吃饭、睡觉和个人卫生保健活动外，你没有任何时间做任何其他事情了。所以遵守三条原则：一周拿一天不要工作：大部分人挑周六或周日，告诉老板除非有十分紧急的事情，否则这一天你绝对不工作。这一天和朋友、家人在一起，或者只是看看报纸，让脑子离开工作一下。别把工作带回家：如果有需要，在办公室多干一个小时，家应该是一个属于你的地方。事先计划：不要在周五从机场回来的路上还在想周末找一些工作去做。如果休息时间除了看书你还想做别的事情，你必须事先做好计划。立下规则的最大好处是让每一个人——上司、恋人（妻子）、孩子、你自己知道并理解你希望怎么样。]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-04-25-Book-StrangeLife%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[培养对时间的管理也能培养出道德情操 人最宝贵的是生命。但是仔细分析一下这个生命，可以说，最宝贵的是时间。因为生命是由时间构成的，是一小时一小时、一分钟一分钟累积起来的。没人能预计他在下一分钟里能发生什么，但至少我们可以记得前一分钟我们做过什么。 这里是要讲述一个将自己的一生用时间来计划的人——柳比歇夫。柳比歇夫通过他的时间统计法对自己进行了研究和试验：试验在写、读、听、工作、思索各方面，他到底能干多少？干多少？怎么干？他不让自己负担过重，力不胜任；他总是循着他能力的边缘前进，他对自己能力的掂量精确无疑。 如果每个人都能知道自己能干些什么，那生活会变得多么美好！因为每个人的能力都比他自己感觉到的大得多，也就不会有那么多的人感叹自己因能力有限而导致一事无成。 柳比歇夫究竟有多牛： 他生前发表了七十来部学术著作。其中有分散分析、生物分类学、昆虫学方面的经典著作;这些著作在国外广为翻译出版。 各种各样的论文和专著，他一共写了五百多印张。五百印张，等于一万二千五百张打字稿。即使以专业作家而论，这也是个庞大的数字。 柳比歇夫的遗产包括几个部分:有著作，探讨地蚤的分类、科学史、农业、遗传学、植物保护、哲学、昆虫学、动物学、进化论、无神论。此外，他还写过回忆录，追忆许多科学家，谈到他一生的各个阶段以及彼尔姆大学…… 他讲课，当大学教研室主任兼研究所一个室的负责人，还常常到各地考察;三十年代他跑遍了俄罗斯的欧洲部分，去过许多集体农庄，实地研究果树害虫、玉米害虫、黄鼠……在所谓的业余时间，作为“休息”，他研究地蚤的分类。单单这一项，工作量就颇为可观:到一九五五年，柳比歇夫已搜集了三十五箱地蚤标本。共一万三千只。其中五千只公地蚤做了器官切片。总计三百种。这些地蚤都要鉴定、测量、做切片、制作标本。他收集的材料比动物研究所多五倍。他对跳甲属的分类，研究了一生。 他的知识面有多广，是很难测度的。谈起英国的君主制度，他能够说出任何一个英国国王临朝秉政的细节;说到宗教，不管是古兰经、犹太传经，还是罗马教廷的源流、马丁·路德的学说、毕达哥拉斯学派的思想……他都是如数家珍。他懂复变数理论、农业经济、罗·费歇的社会达尔文主义、古希腊古罗马，天知道他还精通些什么。]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-04-21-Book-TheRoadLessTraveled1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[正如本书开篇所言：人生苦难重重。M·斯科特·派克让我们更加清楚：人生是一场艰辛之旅，心智成熟的旅程相当漫长。但是，他没有让我们感到恐惧，相反，他带领我们去经历一系列艰难乃至痛苦的转变，最终达到自我认知的更高境界。 M·斯科特·派克，我们这个时代最杰出的心理医生，他的杰出不仅在其智慧，更在于他的真诚和勇气。儿童时，他就以“童言无忌”远近闻名；少年时，他又勇敢地放弃了父母为他安排的辉煌前程，毅然选择了自己的人生道路，最终当上了一名心理医生。他曾在美军日本冲绳基地担任心理医生，为美军军官做心理医生。在近二十年的职业生涯中，他治俞了成千上万个病人，他以从业经验为基础写作的《少有人走的路》，创造了出版史上的一大奇迹。 心智成熟之旅艰苦卓绝，无论是思考还是行动，你都离不开勇敢、进取和独立的精神。即便有先知的告诫，你仍需独自前行。没有任何一位心灵导师能够牵着你的手前进，也没有任何既定的宗教仪式能让你一蹴而就。任何训诫，都不能免除心灵旅行者必经的痛苦。你只有自己选择人生道路，忍受生活的艰辛与磨难，最终才能到达人生新的境界。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[稻盛和夫 - 活法+干法]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-04-20-Book-KazuoInamori%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[“成功和失败都是一种磨难。有人成功了，觉得自己了不得，态度变得令人讨厌，表示其人格堕落了；有人成功了，领悟到只凭自己无法有此成就，因而更加努力，也就进一步提升了自己的人性。而真正的胜利者，无论是成功或者失败，都会利用机会，陶冶出纯净美丽的心灵”。他认为，人生就是提升心智的过程。有了这样的超脱和追求，使得稻盛和夫得以拥有了俯瞰人生的视野。稻盛和夫被业界认为是真正活明白了的人，是商界中的哲学家。他给自己筑起了一座精神山脉，敬天爱人、慎言笃行。他在论及他的商业帝国时曾经说过一句话：“这是利他之心的回报，为对方着想似乎伤害了自己利益，但却带来意想不到的成果。”经商之道，一语中的！ “从事自己喜欢的工作，不足千分之一？……特别是年轻人，价值观尚未定型。” 稻盛和夫的解决方案是，1）拼命做好“命运中碰到的工作”，能有成就感，会带来兴趣和喜欢。2）……还可以起到修行的作用、具备厚重的人格，获得幸福的人生。 个人观点，他的方案对和他有类似品质的人，有用（提示或共鸣），但对于普通大众，缺乏现实的可操作性。有人可能会觉得是“鸡汤”，因为“看了等于没看，还是没改变啊”。。1个月、1年后，他还是那个他。 其实，大多数人，至少这辈子是不需要“修行”的，他们没这个意愿、需求、缘分，他们不是稻盛和夫这种千分之一的、有强烈内驱力的人，他们不是CEO，他们只是普通人，只想过好生活，只想能安稳一些、快乐一些，仅此而已。 稻盛和夫说“我劝你们更加努力……如果努力达到这种程度，你或者会获得灵感，就像神给你的礼物一样，或者就会出现承认你的努力、向你伸出援手的人。”我想说，现实中90%的人，这辈子都不会那么拼命努力的。这也是鸡汤反对派的一个槽点“把技术性问题简化成努力性问题”。（其实吧，他这个观点不能说错，只不过，只对稻盛和夫这种“会去那么努力”的人适用。。） 发散的说，命运中碰到的工作，本质意义，不一定是为了有成就感，可能反而是为了让某个人能获得挫折，获得内在灵性的反思和提升。再往大了讲，为了获得成就感、喜欢、兴趣（而做事），本身就是痛苦的因、轮回的因。 回头说，这些鸡汤真正起效的前提，是你能将内驱力、灵魂深处的东西唤醒出来。 但有个问题，稻盛和夫这么high level的人，难道不懂这个道理吗？我不太相信。 那他为什么还要说这些话呢？可能是因为1）他只是在播种，认为总有一天会“结果”的，也可能是这些人的下辈子；2）他没有更好更高级的办法，或者有，但不适合公开说。不是因为小气或保密，而是因为这90%的人，缺少积累和历练，听不懂，说了反而很可能对他是伤害。3）他没去想“对90%普通人，更有实操性的解决方案”。 个人尝试想了下，可能对普通人有实操性的方案是： 不要想着从事自己“喜欢”的工作，而是想着从事自己“擅长”的工作——擅长的本质意义，不在于自己是否快乐（很多时候，虽然是你擅长，但是会让你短期不那么快乐的），而在于能“干得顺手”，进而能为他人、社会创造更大价值。 做“擅长”工作的结果，能让自己内心更加充实、圆满；也会带来快乐、成就感、兴趣——他们并不是不存在、或不需要，而只是“附属产物”（附属产物的概念很重要，我们经常把一些附带价值或次级目标，当成了核心价值或根本目标）。 如何遇到并发现自己擅长的工作呢？个人观点：先做加法、再做减法、最后做排序。1、年轻时，没有可评判的备选项，就应该多去经历。不要畏首畏尾，年轻是最大的机会，也是最大的机会成本。2、当精力顾不过来时，需要“知止”，需要开始“做减法”，挑重点方向去深入了解。3、评判自己“是否擅长”的可操作标准是 当领导突然给你一个重要、紧急、有难度的事情时，你“本能”的反应是“恐惧、烦躁、压力大、绝望、逼不出来”，还是反而有点“动力、兴趣、觉得大概能想出办法的”。 是否会主动去学、去想某种“现在还没排上，但将来会需要的”东西；并且，学的时候，感觉非常“顺”，也说不出什么原因。 有时，反而是别人看得更清楚，你擅长什么，不擅长什么，适当的听取外部的声音。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[初学者的冥想书]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-04-19-MeditationNote%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[好的冥想练习有很多种。若要配得上这个“好”字，则必须有助于修习者发展对身体和感受的觉察，对意识和内心的觉察。无论选择哪种冥想方式，关键在于作出选择之后，就该坚持到底。 冥想并不意味着我们必须成为佛教徒、禅者或灵性之人，它仅仅是邀请我们唤醒自身的觉醒潜能。或许正念、活在当下、慈悲和觉醒，这些都是我们坐在蒲团上冥想时的收获，然而，这种觉察力将在生活的方方面面予我们以馈赠。 冥想并非聚焦于某一特殊的意识状态，因为所有的意识状态最终都必将改变。冥想训练我们时刻保持觉察，以一颗敞开的心和明澈的视角面对世界，活在当下。让我们得以进一步敞开自己，学会全然的爱，并能无所畏惧地表达这种爱，这些都是来自于冥想的美妙礼物。 与呼吸同在，这种练习就像训练一只小狗。你抱起它，放在一张报纸上，告诉它呆着别乱动。它会乖乖听话吗？不可能。患有多动症的心智也是如此。你必须再次抱起狗狗放回去，告诉它乖乖呆着别动。如此重复多次，小狗才会听话。 当你安静地坐着，身体自然会渐渐敞开。在这份敞开中，你会留意到被忙碌的日常生活所掩盖的诸多事物。请铭记一点，若在冥想中注意到身体的打开，切勿用理智决定它该如何。静坐当如千瓣莲花盛开，每一片花瓣的舒展都有它自己的时机与节拍。 有许多人以为必须解决了所有问题，我们才能真正开始冥想。事实上，一切问题都是旅途的重要组成部分。何谓好、何谓坏，我们对此有太多的看法，却从未真正明白。有些时候，全然体验某种我们不欢迎的情绪（如愤怒、憎恨），能让我们走向自己需要学习的功课。 我们凭借冥想向一切生命之歌、所有能量之舞敞开。以呼吸为核心，令自己安静、平和，而后怀着善意与接纳，以这份觉察去迎接所出现的一切。如此一来，无论发生何事，皆能成为冥想的一部分。 宽恕绝非纵容。宽恕的本质是不将任何人从心中驱逐出去，哪怕是那些深陷无知、困惑、痛苦的泥沼无力自拔，并因此伤害他人之辈。宽恕也意味着放下过去，即使确实有错铸成，无法补救，亦难挽回，但前方崭新的道路已然展开。 慈心观是一项古老的修炼，我们要做的是先对自己散播爱，之后将慈爱传递给我们所爱的人，最后扩展到一切众生。慈心观的美妙之处在于可以随时随地修炼。在街头散步时，在挤公交时，在坐飞机时，你都一样可以修习——“愿他喜乐安康，愿他心中充满慈悲。” 食禅的重点是让所有声音都进入意识层面，看清楚哪种是自己习惯追随的，之后学着去聆听其他的声音。若想点燃生活中的智慧，关键就在于，无论你是否坐在蒲团上，都要将觉察之光带入自己的经验。日日皆食，且不止一次，食禅正是发展觉知的绝佳机会。 哪怕是在最忙碌、最容易被打扰的日子里，行禅也是极好的修炼。当你心无旁骛地来回走着，你很快就能意识到，重点并非取得某些进展，而是待在此时此地——毋庸置疑，冥想的精髓即在于此。 唯有发现自身的愤怒与仇恨之源，我们才能明白它在外部世界的运作。唯有懂得如何走出自己内心的恐惧与偏见，问题才能获得真正的解决。若想做到这一点，我们就要学会如实地看待这个世界，无惧苦痛，不贪欢愉。无论遇到何人何事，都能够敞开自己的心。 请记住，冥想无法成为一件技艺成品，它是一种终身的修行。若你能与呼吸、身体感受、念头和情绪能量共处，你就能在任何生活场景中保持冷静与好奇。让事情简单些吧！内观的关键在于觉察当下的一切，而非追求殊胜的体验。不妨以赤子之心敞开自己，那将帮助你发现当下一刻的生命真相。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[六项精进.pptx稻盛和夫简介 稻盛和夫1932年出生于日本鹿儿岛，鹿儿岛大学工学部毕业。27岁创办京都陶瓷式会社（现名京瓷Kyocera），52岁创办第二电电（原名DDI，现名KDDI，目前在日本为仅次于NTT的第二大通讯公司），这两家公司又都在他的有生之年进入世界500强，两大事业皆以惊人的力道成长。 Hot Tip : “六项精进”是搞好企业经营所必须的最基本条件，同时也是我们度过美好人生必须遵守的最基本条件。如果我们每天都能持续实践这“六项精进”，我们的人生必将更加美好，甚至超乎我们自己的想象。我自己的人生就是如此。 付出不亚于任何人的努力 拼命工作的同时又能思考如何改进工作，那么你的每一天都会充满创意。今天要比昨天好，明天要比今天好，这样不断琢磨，反复思索，就会生出好想法，产生有益的启迪。 拼命工作可以磨练灵魂。从早到晚辛勤劳作，就没有空闲。古话说：“小人闲居不为善”。人这种动物，一旦有了闲暇，就会动不正经的念头，干不正经的事。但如果忙忙碌碌、专注于工作，就不会有非分之想，没有时间考虑多余的东西了。 禅宗的和尚和修道的修行者们，在刻苦修行的过程中磨练自己的灵魂。将心思集中到一点，抑制杂念狂想，不给它们作祟的空间，通过这样的修行，整理自己的心绪，磨练自己的心志，造就纯粹而优秀的人格。因此说，拼命工作和修行过程一样，能磨练人的灵魂。 要谦虚，不要骄傲我认为：谦虚是最重要的人格要素。“要谦虚，不要骄傲”并非只针对成功后骄傲自大的人，而是要求经营者在小企业成长为大企业的整个过程中，始终保持谦虚的态度。 年轻的时候，我知道了中国的一句古话：“唯谦是福”。不谦虚就不能得到幸福，能得到幸福的人都很谦虚。从京瓷还是中小企业的时候起，我就崇尚谦虚。公司经营顺利，规模扩大，人往往会翘尾巴，傲慢起来，但我总是告诫自己，绝对不能忘记谦虚二字。 “谦受福”是一句非常重要的格言，我下决心信守这句格言。在这个世界上，有些人用强硬手段排挤别人，看上去也很成功，其实不然。真正的成功者，尽管胸怀火一般的热情和斗志，但他们同时也是谦虚的人、谨慎的人。 要每天反省一天结束以后，回顾这一天，进行自我反省是非常重要的。比如说，今天有没有让人感到不愉快?待人是否亲切?是否傲慢?有没有卑怯的举止?有没有自私的言行?回顾自己的一天，对照做人的准则，确认言行是否正确，这样的作业十分必要。抑制自己的邪恶之心，让良心占领思想阵地，这个作业过程就是“反省”。所谓良心指的是“真我”，也就是利他之心，怜爱他人，愿他人过得好。与此相反的是“自我”，指的是利己心，只要自己好，不管别人。贪婪之心就属于“自我”。 自己的言行中，如果有值得反省之处，哪怕只有一点点，也要改正。和第一项一样，天天反省也能磨练灵魂、提升人格。为了获得美好的人生，通过每天的反省，来磨练自己的灵魂和心志是非常重要的。 “竭尽全力拼命工作”，再加上“天天反省”，我们的灵魂就会被净化，就会变得更美丽，更高尚。我常说：提高心性就能扩展经营。也就是说，不磨练自己的灵魂，就无法搞好经营。我经常和大家谈到这一点，我想和大家一起遵循这个原则。 活着，就要感谢“感谢”非常重要。我们要感谢周围的一切，这是理所当然的，因为我们不可能单身一人活在这世上。空气、水、食品、还有家庭成员、单位同事，还有社会，我们每个人都在周围环境的支持下才能生存。不，与其说是“生存”，不如说是“让我生存”,有了感谢之心，我们就能感受到人生的幸福。 我活着，不，让我有活着的机会，我当然要表示感谢，这样我就会感受到幸福。有了这样一颗能感受幸福的心，我就能活得更加滋润，让自己的人生更加丰富，我相信这一点。 不要牢骚满腹，对现状要无条件地表示感谢，在此之上，再朝着更高的目标努力奋斗。首先，就“让我活着”这一点，向神表示感谢，向自己周围的一切说一声“谢谢！”我们要在“道谢”声中度过自己的每一天。 “谢谢”、“不敢当、不胜感激”、“不胜惶恐”这些词汇，都会自己愉快，还给包括对象在内的周围的人们带来好影响，真是好词语。 积善行、思利他中国有句古语，叫做“积善之家有余庆”，意思是，多行善，就会有好报。 另一方面，也听过这样的事：真心帮助别人，结果反而自己倒霉。比如说，为了帮朋友解脱困境，去充当他的贷款连带保证人，本以为做了善事，想不到出了麻烦。还有一种情况，朋友有困难开口借钱，你借给他了，他却迟迟不还，让你陷入困境。 “不是说善有善报吗？怎么我做善事却得到了恶报？”有人这么说。我认为这种说法不对。 在那样的场合，只凭感情，只凭同情，就慷慨解囊，或当他的连带保证人，这本身就是一个问题。我曾对大家讲过，作为判断的基准之一，有“大善”和“小善”之分。朋友手头紧，找上门求你帮忙，仅仅因为他来求你，你就同情他，不假思索就出钱相助，表面上看你是帮了他，实际上是害了他，使这位不负责任的朋友变得更不负责任。他之所以债台高筑，原因在于此人做事马虎，花钱大手大脚，缺乏计划性。如果你可怜他而借钱给他的话，反而会助长他那马虎和挥霍的坏习性。迁就朋友的不合理要求，这是“小善”，你关爱和同情他的方式不对，是帮他的倒忙，让他越陷越深。 俗话说“孩子可爱也要让他经风雨、见世面”。乍一看来，这种对孩子的“大善”近乎非情。 朋友找上门来借钱，央求你作他的连带保证人，这时，首先你要问清楚事情的来龙去脉，要认真调查，如果是由于他做事不检点，乃至挥霍浪费才导致了今天的结果，那么你应该断然地拒绝他，明确告诉他，这个钱不能借，而且，你还要劝导他正视眼前的困难，接受教训，重新振作起来。 为了让人生更幸福，为了让经营更出色，希望大家多行善事、多作对他人有益的事。 不要有感性的烦恼过去的失败，反省之后就坚决把它忘掉，将精力投进新的工作 担心、烦恼、失败等等，是人生的常事。但是，覆水难收，总为已经的失败而悔恨，毫无意义。老是闷闷不乐会引起心病，接下来会引发身体的毛病，最终给自己的人生带来不幸。不要让已经过去的事再困扰自己，心里要想新的事情，新的想法要转移到新的行动上去，这一点很重要。 要对过去的事进行深刻的反省，但不要因此在感情和感性的层面上伤害自己，加重自己的心理负担。要运用理性来思考问题，迅速地将精力集中到新的思考和新的行动中去。我认为，这样做就能开创人生的新局面。 工作失败，我们会很失望，很懊悔。但是，无论失望也好，懊悔也好，失败了的事情不可能从头再来。后悔、烦恼没有意义，这个道理即使明白，我们仍然会想：“那一点当初如果做好了，就会如何如何……”等等，照样后悔，照样烦恼。这个毛病要改。 已经发生了的事既然无法改变，就干脆地把它忘掉，将全副精力投入到新的工作中去，这是最要紧的。 灾难的发生，是自己过去犯下的罪孽的报应，如果不殃及性命，到此为止的话，那反而是值得庆贺的事。这样一想，摆脱烦恼，人就轻松了，可以将这事忘掉，转而在新的人生旅途上坚强地、满怀希望地走下去。 对挫折和灾难抱上述正面的态度，才会有一个幸福的人生。 这个观点非常重要。估计今后经济的不景气将越发严重，销售货款无法回收，到手的支票不能兑现，等等，会发生各种纠纷或灾难。超越这些障碍，不让感性的烦恼困扰自己，朝前看，坚强地活下去，这才是最重要的。 希望大家务必学习并实践这“六项精进”，使经营更出色，让人生更精彩! 谢谢！]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[简爱跑步法 - 五个字决：挺、倾、柔、衡、坚。 “挺”。弯腰可能含胸，城市影响到呼吸体系，限定身材去更多地纳入氧气。在长间隔耐力项目中，摄氧是很重要的一个环节，只有把胸腔打开，把身材挺直，氧气才气舒畅而顺畅地插手身材的轮回，这么做一是为了跑得更悦目，二为了吸入更多的氧气。 “倾”。它是指让身材重心微微前倾，让重心稍稍有所失衡，我们只必要共同着抬起腿，重力就会发动你往前，这是一种很怪异的感受，它得当于一般慢跑，由于省力，它根基上不必要太多的行使肌肉发力，就可以或许用惯性敦促我们往前飞跃。 “柔”：喂授跑步的时辰第一时刻触及地面的是前脚掌，接着用全脚掌去做缓冲。在这个进程中，足弓、脚踝和膝盖三个部位形成了一个相同于汽车避震器这样一个部件，假如我们能运用好这三个避震器，那么跑步给膝盖带来的攻击，有很大一部门就可以在这三个部位被缓冲掉了。比起纯真地把攻击转达给膝盖，这个做法要智慧得多，由于它极大地停止了膝盖受伤的也许性。这就是“柔”这个字诀的焦点，奈何才气做好这个要点呢？有一个浅显可行的自我鉴定步伐，那就是，当我们向前飞跃的时辰，脚后跟的部位不该该逾越我们的膝盖。 “坚”指的是焦点肌群应该足够强健。在跑步进程中。只有“柔”没有“坚”，还不能担保安详的飞跃。“坚”这个字起首针对的是膝盖周围的肌肉，尤其是股二头肌，它得足够强健，才气具备对跑步的足够的支撑力，它把我们的膝盖整个包裹了，似乎一种自然护膝。强健的肌群可以让我们的举措稳固形，而且可以或许遭受较大的攻击。 “衡”。有一回，在一场马拉松赛事中，我见一位黑人运带动跑过告白牌，我心中发出一声赞叹，假如不看他的脚，只看上半身映衬在告白牌上的行进感，我会觉得他正在举办自行车角逐，那是一种很是安稳、相同滑行的举措，根基上没有呈现什么垂直颠簸。归去往后，我买了一个新设备，就是佳明的Fenix2，这个手表共齐心率带，可以提供三项数据:垂直升沉、触地时刻以及步频。我看了数据，我的升沉在十一到十二厘米，而我又查察了那些跑得较量好的人，他们一样平常都能把本身的升沉节制在十厘米以内。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[步行冥想和行禅]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-04-10-Habit-WalkingMeditation%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[本书将告诉你：行走不是为了到达某个终点，而是一次触及世间万物和心灵的机会；通过呼吸将灵魂和思想统一成一种惯性的正面力量；通过冥想来化解你情感中的波折，比如愤、焦虑等。 在《步行冥想》的教诲之下，无论我们的内在差异有多大，都能够重新发现：快乐与平和才是我们的家！ 冥想可以减轻人们精神上的痛苦和烦躁，但并不能帮助我们避免问题或困难。冥想就是要学会如何停止——停止过去人生中的遗憾，停止当前的愤恨或绝望，或停止对于未来的忧虑。通过这种停止的艺术，我们可以融入当下，被充斥在自己内心和周围的美丽与奇迹所滋养：花儿的清香、阳光的温暖、天空的色彩。而内观修行就是要去领悟到，我们总是面临着选择——是选择放松身心抛开烦恼，还是选择继续奔忙永无休止；是选择愤怒，还是选择欢乐。一旦我们选择了停止，一切都会变好起来。 在学习步行冥想之前，最开始要掌握如何用心去呼吸。这是帮助我们学习放松和停止艺术最好的方式。当在呼吸并且用心感知到自己正在呼吸时，我们那些飘扬行走的思绪才会停留到气息的吞吐之中，放松下来，一种平静和舒适的感觉将油然而生。 用心去呼吸冥想是为了培养你的内观，学习如何使之产生、活跃以及增强。当你知道如何使内观产生力量时，任由它渗透到自己的一切言行之中，理解、热情、善心将会自然地在你心灵之中不断滋生。一开始，只有在慢步时你才会认为自己在培养内观，但也许以后甚至是泡茶时也会成为你进行这种修行的方式之一：也许，某一个静雅的清晨，泡上茶叶端起茶壶的那一刹那，你在突然之间闻到比以往任何时候都更为浓郁的茶叶清香。品上一口，你会觉得茶水变得更为甘洌，这就是因为你制造出的内观力量使自己能够更为直接和深刻地体会到它的滋味。 呼吸就是肉体的一部分，当思绪与呼吸通过用心呼吸的方式而取得联系时，你的思绪与自己的肉体也就有了联系。真正的放松和宁静会随着用心呼吸而自然产生，依靠这种方式，人的肉体、呼吸和思想将融合成为一个整体。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[第一章 钱之初，性本善（希腊—罗马）在优雅的希腊文明中，我们已经看到了金融的原形：你有，给你更多；你没有，把现在的也拿走。经过梭伦改革，雅典在公民间建立了一个纺锤形社会，在相对公平的体制下，人类社会开始了金融之旅。然而，嗜血的罗马只是“手中有钱，心中无剑”，在声色犬马中贵族开始无视社会规则甚至法律，当所有公民都无法谨守俭朴和忠诚时，在一次大通胀中，罗马的辉煌戛然而止。雅典辉煌的秘密是什么？罗马共和国真的死于大通胀吗？ 第二章 迷失的货币（法兰克帝国）罗马人喜欢称日耳曼民族为“蛮族”，这个民族终结了欧洲当时所有的金融活动，人们开始向城堡退却。这种西欧城堡才是真正的小农经济，农奴非但没有货币，甚至终生都难以走出这个石头墙。北欧海盗以摧枯拉朽之势冲垮了封建城堡，也孕育出了第一代国际“倒爷”，西欧商品经济开始复苏。中西小农究竟有什么分别？真实的海盗又如何能成为金融滥觞？ 第三章 暗黑年代（中世纪）当国王和农奴同时成为封建领主的掘墓人，货币终于在西欧城镇中浴火重生，自此，西欧中世纪不再平静。九次十字军东征造就了世界第一代金融枭雄——圣殿骑士，也造就了一个迄今为止难解的达·芬奇密码；百年英法战争结束了英法两国强势王权，也缔造了西欧独一无二的金融市场。达·芬奇密码中圣殿骑士的宝藏究竟是不是史实？谁才是英法百年战争中真正的英雄？ 第四章 邻家金融初长成（西班牙、荷兰）西班牙、荷兰都在一个骗子的肩膀上成长，终于也都衰败在强盗逻辑之下。一旦本应属于民间资本的资金被王室挤占，金融制度就可能成为权力掠夺财富的利器。当人们认为自己正在储蓄未来的时候，财富早就被强势权力挥霍一空。为何富可敌国的富格尔家族最终成为西班牙称霸世界的绊脚石？是郁金香危机打垮了世界上第一个日不落帝国荷兰共和国吗？ 第五章 金融强国术（日不落帝国）第一代债券“赎罪券”拉开了基督教宗教改革的序幕，宗教改革，上帝哭了，在西欧，第一个被资本主义抢劫的恰恰就是基督教廷。当封建领主开始将女儿下嫁给富裕的农奴时，封建城堡的末日即将来临。英王查理一世错误的融资手段使他丧失了战争先机，最终也为此命丧黄泉。是国王之死为英国带来了资本主义吗？南海泡沫真的是泡沫吗？ 第六章 金融败家术（英法争霸）宗教改革给法国带来了强势王权，然而，强势王权却扶持了一个金融怪才——约翰·劳，一位毁誉参半的伟人，一位真正的当代经济学大厦奠基人。在约翰·劳这位赌王、杀人犯、越狱犯和诈骗犯的悉心指导下，法国金融乃至经济体系终于崩溃，于是，法国迎来了轰轰烈烈的大革命。贫穷的法国革命党没有任何收入来源，是穷困毁掉了法国大革命吗？工业革命之后，西欧列强基本长成，可惜不是我堂堂中华！ 第七章 新世界的呼唤（美国独立）对西欧人来说，美洲是一片新大陆，北美独立战争造就了一个崭新的美利坚合众国。建国初期，美国中央银行两度被撤销，然而就是在一兴一废之间，美利坚合众国孕育出了金融之都——华尔街。纽约证券市场，从诞生之日起就左右着美国经济的一呼一吸，金融市场一半是海水，一半是火焰。独立战争、南北战争，真实的动因有这么伟大吗？美国两度兴废央行，究竟是为了什么？ 第八章 黄金世界（美国崛起）黄金在非著名金融学家牛顿的手中变为货币，自此，英镑成为第一代世界货币。黄金本应为币，但是，在美国，黄金成为货币却颇费周折，就为这事差点把美国财政部搞破产，同时搞了一个美联储出来。美联储，一个商业银行供养的孙子，却成为自己股东的爷爷。这个时代，美国成为托拉斯的世界——城市之羞。是什么原因使得白银退出西方货币舞台？美国人民如何能击溃摩根、洛克菲勒这样富可敌国的家族？ 第九章 枪炮与金钱Ⅰ（一战）第一次世界大战，协约国在美国贷款支持下击溃了德意联盟。然而，巴黎和会后美国又反过来帮助德国摆脱了《凡尔赛和约》的束缚。一战后的货币世界混乱不堪，美国、英国、法国各行其是，终于为二战埋下了火种。一战前后，美国对德态度为何判若两人？德国又如何能在战后反败为胜？ 第十章 枪炮与金钱Ⅱ（二战）1929年纽约金融市场暴跌引发了世界性经济危机，美国、英国、德国无一不是经济衰退，失业率高企，尽管罗斯福新政在一定程度上刺激了美国经济，但这绝非凯恩斯政策的功劳。也是在1929年危机背景下，世界出现了法西斯同盟， 最大的法西斯投资恰恰就是在银行势力扶持下登上历史舞台的。1929年世界大危机，纽约金融市场是真正的始作俑者吗？盟国何以能在二战中反败为胜，最终击溃法西斯？ 第十一章 冷战就是金融战（冷战时代）罗斯福不幸逝世后，杜鲁门和丘吉尔一手造成了二战后的冷战格局。在美国马歇尔计划的支持下，西欧走出了战后废墟，然而，西方世界马上又面临更加棘手的“滞胀”，二战后的世界货币体系也在二十年内崩溃。马歇尔计划是帮欧洲复兴，还是美元称霸世界的阴谋？布雷顿森林体系最终崩溃，是谁的责任？ 第十二章 问世间，是否此山最高（金融新世界）里根通过“星球大战”拖垮了苏联经济，没有了冷战，人类社会的金融危机却层出不穷。日本“衰退的十年”、东南亚金融危机、纳斯达克市场暴涨暴跌……这些其实并非全是美元之过，而是这些经济体系本就存在根深蒂固的恶疾。索罗斯为什么认为现在的西方经济学属于骗子？冷战以来，历次金融危机中西方政府究竟在救市还是在毁灭市场？ 并非尾声（危机年代）美国次贷危机引发全球对结构性金融产品的悲观情绪，是美国历史上百年不遇的金融灾难。一批名震寰宇的公司因此倒下……2008年，人们已经开始习惯将这场衰退称为“全球金融海啸”。贝尔斯登，这只“从不冬眠的熊”为何将永久冬眠？是谁摧毁了雷曼的灵魂？华尔街投资银行的荣耀能否继续？百年通用何以在变形金刚的故乡走到了尽头？]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[领导者的资质]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-04-06-Book-5Leadership%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[领导者的最大作用就是培养追随者，而不断把追随者培养成为领导者的我们应该可以称之为领袖。稻盛哲学阐述具备领导者资格的人首先应该是“以爱为根基的反映民意的独裁者”。 五项资质使命感完成某件事情，要有远大的梦想，要有愿景，而且是对社会是有意义的。这样大家才能同心协力，认同远大的目标。 详细的描述目标并且实施要把奋斗的目标告诉大家，完成激情的传递，最理想的情况下是让大家充满激情，想立刻干这件事情。乐观的构想，悲观的计划，乐观的实施。 敢于做挑战的事情不断的挑战和创新，是企业不断壮大的动力，相反会使企业保守、固步自封。我们要不断的挑战，而不是安逸。 受群众的信任和尊敬 需要公正，不能为了利己或者部分属下的利益，影响公正，失去民心。 需要勇气，比如为了公正要做出一些决断，这可能会伤到部分人的利益，但需要勇气做下去。 需要谦虚，尤其是我们取得了一定的成就之后，更需要谦虚，需要将才都是在取得成功之后，由于傲慢失败了。 应该始终保持乐观开朗的态度。 要有关爱之心要关心下属的生活，努力了解每一个下属的想法，并将他们的力量凝聚在同一个方向上来。这样把团队引向既定的目的地，这就是对领导者的要求。 领导者的十项职责领导者必须向员工说明工作的目的意义，设定具体目标，制定相应的计划，怀着强烈的愿望付出不亚于任何人的努力，表现出坚强的意志，绝不放弃磨砺自己的人格，关爱员工，调动他们的积极性，共同致力于创新。 领导者必须明确事业的目的意义，并向部下指明。 领导者必须设立具体的目标，并制定实现这一目标的计划。不只是自上而下，从目标和计划开始酝酿讨论的阶段，就要让部下一起参与进来，必须让部下意识到，这是我们自己制定的目标计划。在制定目标和计划是领导者必须发挥核心作用，但同时又必须充分听取部下的意见，集中众人的智慧。领导者做的决定必须向部下作透彻的说明，要让部下从内心真正认同接受。 领导者心中要怀有强烈而持久的愿望。稻盛和夫曾提出过这样的经营口号，以渗透到潜意识的强烈而持久的愿望和热情去达成自己设立的目标。 领导者要付出不亚于任何人的努力，必须比谁都更认真，更拼命的工作，让部下看了感动而效仿。京瓷哲学中有一条成为漩涡的中心领导者，在工作时必须把周围的人卷进工作的漩涡。 领导者必须具备坚强的意志，在企业经营中，会遭遇急剧的景气变动和难以预测的事态，这时候，如果领导者缺乏坚强的意志，慢慢已经设立的目标就会轻易的撤销或向下修正，这样做不仅会让目标变得有名无实，而且会让人失去对领导者的信任和尊敬，一旦制定了目标，要有无论如何也必须达成目标的坚强的意志。 领导者需要拥有高尚的人格，或者说领导者必须意识到，自己一定要具备高尚的人格，并不懈努力去提高自己的人格。 领导者无论遭遇什么困难都绝不放弃。 领导者要怀着爱情与部下交往，所谓爱情就是关爱同情体谅就是利他之心，再进一步说就是类似于基督教倡导的爱，释迦牟尼倡导的慈悲那样博大的爱。领导者在日常的业务工作中，要时时把部下的幸福挂在心上。 领导者必须努力调动部下的积极性，鼓动部下的干劲，调动部下的积极性。再不像困惑的时候，要像亲人一样听曲库中深入交谈，并提出建议，另外在部下达成目标或者表现出色时，给予表扬，夸奖很重要，发现部下的长处就要赞赏等等，要营造让部下热情投入工作的团队氛围，这是提升团队士气达成目标的重要因素，引导者务必下功夫做到这一点。 领导者必须富于创造性，不断从事创造性的工作。]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-04-05-OpenSource-Composer%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[composer 是 PHP 的依赖管理工具，本篇文章就来说明如何构建一个包，并提交到 Packagist ，这样别人就可以方便地通过 composer 使用你的包了。 开发 composer 包有以下几个步骤： 初始化 composer.json 文件定义命名空间及包名实现包需要实现的功能提交到 GitHub在 Packagist 注册包初始化 composer.json 文件 安装好 composer 后即可在本地运行 composer init 通过交互式命令行设置 composer.json 。 常规属性的设置name此属性定义包名，以 / 隔开，前面的为供应商名字，后面为包名，供应商代表 Packagist 网站为开发者提供的唯一的名字，用来组织包以及防止命名冲突。所以提交时最好先访问 https://packagist.org/packages/yourvendorname 将 url 中的 yourvendorname 替换为你想要取的名字，如果页面没有 404 ，说明已经被注册了。 license许可证。关于许可证，建议看两篇文章，开源项目 license 介绍 、 如何选择 license require安装当前包所需的依赖。只有所有依赖被安装当前包才会被安装。 autoload此配置下主要是 PSR-4 或者 PSR-0 设置，更推荐使用 PSR-4 标准。http://json-schema.org/ 上介绍了 JSON Schema 的定义以及各个语言对其各种功能的实现，有 validator 的实现，其中JSON Schema Validator 是在线的验证服务。其实最简单的就是使用 composer validate composer.json 来验证文件是否是有错误。 项目结构以 单点登录 SDK 为例，此项目基于 Laravel ，实现了站点接入单点登录系统的简单接入，应用只需在服务端注册并实现指定接口，即可接入 SSO 。项目结构是典型的 MVC 结构，.└── geo └── geosso ├── LICENSE ├── README.md ├── composer.json └── src ├── Contracts ├── Http │ ├── Controllers │ ├── Middleware │ └── Requests ├── ParamsBean ├── Providers ├── Support └── config 项目根目录定义在 src 下，在 composer.json 中也有定义，这样当 composer 加载这个包时就知道如何通过命名空间去解析文件路径。 Http 目录代表请求响应，之下的 Controllers 表示合法请求的控制器，Middleware 代表请求的第一道关卡，通过中间件去拦截请求，Requests 去获取前端请求并对请求过滤。 Contracts 代表接口定义。ParamsBean 代表应用层与底层服务沟通时的参数封装，通过 Bean 去获取各个参数，而不是传递 array 使得调用一致，并且强制接口调用时做类型检测，可以很大程度上统一各层之间的参数传递。 Providers 代表 Laravel 的服务容器，通过服务容器，可以注册路由与配置，加载助手类，绑定接口与其实现。 Support 就是一些助手类，对常用的与逻辑无关的功能的封装，config 代表应用自己的配置，通过 config 可以方便地将配置设置并使用全局函数 config() 调用。 提交至 GitHub按照前面的步骤，一个包就有了基本的骨架，接下来就是上传至 GitHub ，配置项目，集成持续集成服务，发布开源项目许可证。 GitHub 初始化项目时可以选择生成 .gitignore 文件，选择许可证，初始化 README.md 文件，切换至本地的项目目录后，按如下步骤即可将目录上传至 GitHub： git init # 初始化仓库git remote set-url origin –push –add git@github.com:XXX/geosso.git # 添加远程追踪仓库地址git add .git commitgit push origin master 提交至 PackagistPackagist 为 composer 默认获取包元数据信息的地址，从 Packagist 获取到元数据信息后，再从 GitHub 上拉取代码。因此，当把你开发的包上传至 GitHub 后还需要将其在 Packagist 注册，这样全世界的人都能通过 composer 去拉去你的代码了。 提交至 Packagist 只需三个步骤： 注册帐号 在 https://packagist.org/packages/submit 提交开发包 设置 webhook 以便提交包更新后能及时地同步至 Packagist 自此，一个基本的包开发就结束了。通过 composer 来管理 PHP 的依赖，通过编写 composer package 去扩展自己的类库，通过引入其他的类库来填充自己的功能，就不用重复造轮子了。]]></content>

Delta compression using up to 2 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done. Writing objects: 100% (10/10), 644 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done. Total 10 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0) To https://github.com/abel533/Mapper.git 5b83845..ebd3836 master -&gt; master Counting objects: 19, done. Delta compression using up to 2 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.

    <url>%2F%2F2017-03-27-Book-HackersPainters%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[“计算机科学”这个词是不存在的。黑客有时因为“计算机科学”这个词而搞不懂自己到底该做什么。黑客其实并不需要懂太多理论。“编程语言是用来帮助思考程序的，而不是用来表达你已经想好的程序。”大多数黑客是通过实践来学习编程的。黑客需要有灵感。开发软件需要合作，但又不能“合”得过头。黑客需要学会“换位思考”，学会从用户的角度思考问题。 致富最好的办法就是创业。在高技术领域，工作效率越高，额外报酬就越高。创业公司无法改变创造财富的法则，它们只是代表了财富创造曲线远端的一点。创业致富还需要有运气。财富与金钱并不是同义词。财富是最基本的东西，金钱只是专业化的副产品。大多数情况下，世界上可供交换的财富不是一个恒定的量。目前还存在的最大的手艺工人群体就是程序员，他们坐在电脑前就能创造财富。工作就是在一个组织中，与许多人共同合作，做出某种人们需要的东西。一个非常努力工作的员工要比一般的员工创造出多十倍甚至百倍的财富。要致富，需要两样东西：可测量性和可放大性。如CEO，电影明星，基金经理，运动员。小团体里面的人的贡献容易测量，创业公司通过发明新技术盈利，可具备可放大性。创业是有一些潜规则的。自己的财产有了保证，那些想致富的人就会愿意去创造财富。 把品味说成个人偏好可以有效地杜绝争论，但这种说法是不正确的。优秀设计的原则： 好设计是简单设计。 好设计是永不过时的设计。 好设计是解决主要问题的设计。 好设计是启发性设计。 好设计通常是有点趣味性的设计。 好设计是艰苦的设计。 好设计是看似容易的设计。 好设计是对称的设计。 好设计是模仿大自然的设计。 好设计是一种再设计。 好设计是能够复制的设计。 好设计常常是奇特的设计。 好设计是成批出现的。 好设计常常是大胆的设计。 设计与研究的区别看来就在于，前者追求“好”，后者追求“新”。大多数优秀设计都是这样产生的，它们关注用户，并且以用户为中心。低估用户一般来说总是会让设计师出错。编程是以人为本的。为了做出优秀的设计，你必须贴近用户，始终寸步不离，永远站在用户的角度调整自己的构想。士气是设计的关键因素。设计意味着做出符合人类特点和需要的产品。 “出于兴趣，解决某个难题，不管它是否有用，这就是黑客。(Playfully doing something difficult,whether useful or not,that is hacking.)” 直到今天，对黑客最佳的论述： 使用计算机，不应受到任何限制，任何事情都应该亲手尝试一下。 信息应该全部免费。 不信任权威，提倡去中心化。 判断一个人应该看他的技术能力，而不是看其他标准。 你可以用计算机创造美和艺术。 计算机使生活更美好。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[领导力21法则]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-03-22-Book-21Leadership%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[第一法则：盖子法则 领导能力决定一个人办事的成效水平。 你想爬得越高，就越需要领导力；你想发挥更大的影响，就需要更大的影响力。 领导能力常常是一个人及团体办事成效的盖子。如果领导能力强，锅盖就高，反之，团体的发展潜力便会受到限制。 个人和团体的成效与领导力的强弱成正比。 不管在哪一个行业，都可以看到一些聪明、有才干而又成功的人，仅仅因为缺乏领导能力，使得他们的成就大大受限。 第二法则：影响力法则 衡量一个人的领导力，全看他所发出的影响力。 当人们愿意跟随你，哪怕只是出于好奇，都足以表明你已经是一个优秀的领导者，散发出领导的魅力。 头衔唯一能够买到的是一点点时间，使你有机会增加自己的影响力，或者，毁掉它。 要成为一个领袖，不仅自己必须在前面带头走，而且还得有人愿意跟随身后。 第三法则：跟随法则 领导力来自日积月累，而非一日之功。 一个人开发与提升技巧的能力，决定他是否能成为领袖。 开始察觉自己对事实的无知，乃是迈向知的一大步。 人的一生中，成功的秘诀是当机会来临时，你已经预备好自己。 领袖不是一天养成的，必须投入毕生的工夫才能成就。 第四法则：导航法则 谁都可以掌舵，但惟有领袖才会设定航线。 所谓领袖即是看得比别人仔细，比别人远，而且比别人早一步先看到。 不管你过去经验多么丰富，仍然无法预知现今一切的状况。 一个计划是否被接纳，得到支持并获致成功，其主要因素并不在于计划有多大，而是他的领袖有多好。 第五法则：哈顿法则 真正的领袖一开口，人们就洗耳恭听。 真正的领袖拥有权力，而不单是拥有职位。 领袖真正的考验不在于开始的时候，而在于结束时的地位。 人们倾听，不见得是因为话语中所含的真理或信息，而是因为他们敬重说话的人。 第六法则：根基法则 信任乃是领导的根基。 说到领导，不管你带领这群人有多久，你绝对不能取巧走捷径。 领导就是策略与品格二者的有效结合，然而，如果须二者舍其一，宁可舍去策略。 欲取得人们的信任，领袖必须是：能力、关系和品格这几种特质的示范。 每个人的成就都无法超越他的品格上限。 第七法则：敬佩法则 人们只想跟随比自己强的领袖。 通常一个人领导能力越高，就会越快地观察出别人身上领导能力的强弱。 有许多方法可以衡量一位跟从者对领袖的尊重程度，当一位领袖在团体中发动重大变革时，就能考验出他所受到的尊重程度。 第八法则：直觉法则 领袖善用领导的知觉来评估每一件事。 一个领袖的领导直觉常能使他从一般领袖中脱颖而出，从而成为一个杰出的领袖。 成功的领袖必定拥有直觉，他们习惯使用自己的领导直觉来评估每件事物。 领袖具有一种能够退到远处纵观全局的能力，不仅能回顾过去，并且能够预测未来，就好像能从风中嗅出变化的气息一般。 第九法则：磁力法则 物以类聚，你是什么样的人，就吸引怎样的人来跟随你。 你找到的人未必是你想要的，而是你自己是怎样的人，就会吸引怎样的人来跟随你。 好的领袖知道，成功的秘诀在于找到人才来弥补他的短处，这样他就能专心致志地做他较擅长的事情。 如果你认为属下应该有更好的素质，那么这该是你提升自己素质的时候了。 第十法则：亲和力法则 卓有成效的领袖知道，在你要别人伸手支持之前，得先感动他们的心。 与人亲善的秘诀在于认识到：即使在一个团体里，你也必须把人当成个体看待。 如果想要人跟随你，就不可低估与人建立关系所产生的力量。 带领自己用头脑就足够了；带领他人，要用心才行。 第十一法则：核心圈法则 核心圈的水平，足以决定你的成就。 领袖的潜力是否能发挥，取决于核心成员的素质。如果这些人有能力，领袖就能带出极大的影响，不然，领袖也无能为力。 领袖身边的核心圈足以影响领袖，以及影响整个组织潜力的发挥。 第十二法则：授权法则 有安全感的领袖才肯授权与人。 最好的主管懂得找到人才来做好计划中的工作，而且又能克制自己在过程中不横加干涉。 你如果想做个成功的领袖，就必须懂得授权。 授权式的领导模式不依赖于职位权威，而是使所有人都有机会负起领导的角色，如此一来，他们就能轮番贡献自己的长处。 第十三法则：增值法则 名师出高徒，只有领袖才能带出领袖。 栽培其他领袖的惟一方法，就是使自己成为更好的领袖。 组织成长的潜能取决于领袖是否拥有更多良好的人才，领导人才越多，成功的可能性就越大。 如果你想继续成长而成为一个领袖，就得花时间与最优秀的领导在一起。 领袖不会群聚在一起，你必须一次一个地把他们挑出来。 第十四法则：接纳法则 想要人们认同你的想法，必须先让他们接受你这个人。 领袖先找到目标，然后才找到一群跟随者；而一般人却是先找到了领袖，然后才认同领袖的目标。 人们一旦拥护某人，就乐意跟随他的目标，人们乐意追随那些他们能够认同的人。 身为领袖，如果事情不成功就得不到任何肯定。不能因为你做“对”的事就有功劳，成功是以你是否有能力带领众人前往他们认同的目标来衡量。 第十五法则：致胜法则 领袖必须为他的团队找出一条致胜之路 伟大的领袖在压力下最能发挥潜力，而使它们内在的特质得以浮现出来。 一个团队不管拥有多少人才及潜力，惟有当所有成员具有统一的目标时才可能成功。 斗士的心态——为求生存而奋斗的精神，乃是创造本公司文化的原动力。 第十六法则：动能法则 动能是领袖最好的朋友。 唯有那些能够引发他人动力的领袖才能够创造出动能。 动能起动的时候最困难，而一旦开始前进，你就会发现真的可以做些惊人的大事。 如果你渴望在团队中有所作为，千万不要忽视动能所带来的力量。动能真的是领袖最好的朋友，只要你设法建造起动能，就有可能成就任何事情。 第十七法则：优先次序法则 领袖们必须明白，忙碌不见得就会有成就。 有许多东西会吸引我的眼睛，但是只有少数几件能吸引我的心。 身为领导，要把大部分的时间花在你最强的领域。如果你的团队中有人能承担你手中的工作，而且能作到你水准的八成，那么，就应该将它交出去。 第十八法则：“舍”“得”法则 领袖必须懂得先“舍”，然后才能有“得”。 成功的领袖如果想扭转公司的命运，非得保持一种牺牲的态度不可，他必须心甘情愿地付出代价才能把公司带上轨道。 领导就是树立榜样，当你身处领导地位时人们就会仿效你的每一个动作。 今日有许多人想要登上领导的宝座，期待着有朝一日登上高位就能享有自由与权力。他们完全不了解领导真正的本质乃是牺牲。 当领导者一定得牺牲。而这种牺牲是一种持续的过程，并非只是一次性的付出而已。 第十九法则：时机法则 掌握时机与善用策略同样重要。 当适当的领袖配上正确的时机，令人振奋的结果就会产生。 了解到该做些什么是一回事，而抓住时机确实另一回事。 领袖如果一再展现出他缺乏良好的判断力，哪怕犯的不过是些小错，人们还是会开始觉得，如果继续接受此人领导，那才是真正的错误。 第二十法则：爆炸性倍增法则 培养追随者，得到相加的效果。 培养领导者，得到相乘倍增的效果。 我身边的人个个都有无穷的潜力，需要有人调教栽培，但我却忙于自己在领导及经营上的成长，而无暇顾及培育周围这些人才，结果，他们就流失了。 任何遵循“爆炸性的倍增”法则的领袖，将从跟随者的成长模式转换为领导者的成长模式。 只要你肯培训人才，领袖就会浮现出来。 你所培养的领袖越优秀，他所带近来的追随者与领袖的素质就越优秀，而且数量越多。 第二十一法则：传承法则 一位领袖的历史地位有赖于顺利传承。 领导力是无法委托别人来发挥的，你如果不运用它，就得放弃它。 就像球队，教练需要一群好球员才能赢，同样，一个团队也需要一群好领袖才能成功。 成功不是看你跟前接手做什么，而是看你身后留下了的是什么。 约翰C马克斯韦尔简介 美国著名的领导学专家，音久集团I.Joy Group）的创办人。该组织致力于帮助人们发挥自己最大的个人潜能和领导才能。同时，他也是非赢利组织“Equip”的创办人。每年，马克斯韦尔都要对超过25万以上的人发表演说，并通过研讨会、书籍和录音带影响一百多万人的生活。到目前为止，他已经写了24本书，其中最著名的有《领导力21法则》、《领导人21品质》、《做一个有影响力的人》、《成功之旅》、《培养你内在的领导才能》和《栽培你身边的领导人才》。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[1、管理的基本职能。职能一：计划制定目标并确定达成这些目标所必需的行动。所有层次的管理者都必须为其工作小组制定计划。包括： 研究活动条件 制定业务决策 编制行动计划 实施目标和战略管理职能二：组织管理活动的根本职能，其它活动的保证和依托。包括： 设计组织机构和结构 设计岗位，人员配备 建立组织制度 监督组织运行 实施组织变革和人力资源开发职能三：领导领导是一门非常奥妙的艺术，贯穿于整个管理中。 沟通信息 统一思想和行动 激励组织成员职能四：控制控制是管理工作不可分割的一部分，控制的实质是使计划与实际作业动态适应。包括： 确立标准 衡量绩效 纠正偏差管理是由计划、组织、领导、控制等职能组成的系统过程 2、管理者的定义、分类（按地位）及其职责，什么是管理错位？（50）定义：管理者是在组织中从事管理工作并对此负责的人，其区别于其他角色的显著特征是管理者拥有直接下属。通过综合运用人力资源和其他资源，以有效地实现目标的过程。分类（按地位）及其职责： 高层管理者:对组织负全责。主要侧重于沟通组织与外部的联系和决定组织的大政方针。注重良好环境的创造和重大决策的正确性。 中层管理者:承上启下。主要职责是正确领会高层的指示精神，创造性地结合本部门的工作实际，有效指挥各基层管理者开展工作。注重的是日常管理事务。 基层管理者:主要职责是直接指挥和监督现场作业人员，保证完成上级下达的各项计划和指令。他们主要关心的是具体任务的完成。 管理错位：常见的错位表现高层：事必躬亲中层：上传下达基层：只拉车不看路或无视上级的指示 3、管理者的职权：支配权、强制权、奖赏权。 支配权 命令 服从 工作需要 管理者工作职责范围内强制权 威胁 迫使 下属惧怕 下属履行应尽职责奖赏权 奖励 诱使 交换原则 下属从事额外工作 支配权:管理者拥有的支配权局限于管理者的工作职责范围之内。工作需要 强制权:是和威胁相联系的迫使他人服从的力量。强职权只适用于管理者要求下属履行其职责范围内的工作。强制权发生作用的基础是下属的惧怕。 奖赏权:奖赏权是建立在交换原则基础之上的。（佩服小强（蟑螂）能上电梯去值班履行管理者职能） 4、管理者应具备的三种基本技能：技术技能、人际技能、概念技能。（记住人参是不能顶着锅盖去妓院的，这不是他的基本技能呀） 技术技能：是指执行一项特定的任务所必需的能力。履行决策，计划，组织，控制等管理职能的基础。 人际技能：是指与人共事，激励或指导组织中的各类员工或群体的能力。获取信息，履行领导职能，组织落实和创造良好的组织环境所必需。 概念技能：是指一种洞察既定环境复杂程度的能力和减少这种复杂性的能力。履行决策和指挥职责所必需。综上，并不是什么人都适合走上管理者岗位的。科学管理之父——泰勒 美国 《《科学管理原理》行为科学的创始人——梅约 美国（霍桑试验）《工业文明中人的问题》一般管理理论 现代经营管理之父——法约尔 法国人 主要著作：《工业管理与一般管理》他认为管理的成功取决于是否灵活地贯彻管理的一系列原则。官僚组织理论 组织理论之父——韦伯 德国 《社会和经济组织的理论》名著推荐 《新教伦理与资本主义精神》定量管理思想认为 有效管理的关键在于度的把握，只有致力于定量化，才能真正提高管理的效率与效益。权变管理思想认为 世界上不存在普遍适用的最佳的管理理论与方法，每一种管理理论与方法都有其一定的适用范围。勒温理论：领导的工作作风：专制作风，民主作风，放任自流作风。四分图理论：领导行为分为以人为重和以工作为重。管理方格理论：贫乏的管理：不称职的管理； 任务式的管理：员工没有进取精神；领导权变理论：费特勒模型、应变领导模式理论。人性假设理论：人之所以会采取某种特定的行为是由其动机所决定的激励理论:]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[异类]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-03-17-Book-Outliers%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[内容简介《异类》带我们走进了成功人士的世界，意外揭开一连串令人惊异的统计结果：英超联赛大多数球员都在9月至11月出生；比尔•盖茨和史蒂夫•乔布斯都生于1955年；纽约很多著名律所的开创者竟都是犹太人后裔，并且其祖辈大多在纽约服装行业谋生。为什么会出现这种情况？原因在于：英超球员的注册时间是每年9月，在同龄球员中，9月出生的人实际上比8月出生的人几乎大了一岁，一岁之差对他们的职业生涯影响巨大；1955年前后正是计算机革命时期，出生太早，无法拥有个人电脑，而出生太晚，计算机革命的时机又被别人占去……因此，那些奇才异类得感谢机遇的眷顾。另外，他们的成功还需要上辈人的文化熏陶，与文化传承息息相关：中国人的数学优势得益于中国人种植水稻的勤劳精神和汉字读音的简洁明了；20世纪90年代初韩国较高的飞机失事率，也是由韩国上下级之间过于严格的等级制度造成的。 怪才格拉德威尔告诉我们，如果没有机遇和文化、环境因素，即便是智商超过爱因斯坦，也只能做一份平庸的工作。 《异类》带领我们找到了成功的根源，发现了更深刻的成功契机，也为社会变革带来新的启示。 作者简介马尔科姆•格拉德威尔（Malcolm Gladwell）被《快公司》誉为“21世纪的彼得•德鲁克”，曾是《华盛顿邮报》商务科学专栏作家，目前是《纽约客》杂志专职作家。2005年被《时代》周刊评为全球最有影响力的100位人物之一。他的代表作品《引爆点》、《异类》、《眨眼之间》均创造了书市神话。《纽约时报》更是把格拉德威尔对社会思潮的影响称为“格拉德威尔效应”（Gladwell Effect）。]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-03-15-MySQL-Index%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Mysql中的Btree与Hash索引比较B-Tree 索引特征 O(log(n)) B-Tree索引可以被用在像=,&gt;,&gt;=,&lt;,&lt;=和BETWEEN这些比较操作符上。而且还可以用于LIKE操作符，只要它的查询条件是一个不以通配符开头的常量。 Hash 索引特征 O(1) Hash类型的索引有一些区别于以上所述的特征： 它们只能用于对等比较，例如=和&lt;=&gt;操作符（但是快很多）。它们不能被用于像&lt;这样的范围查询条件。假如系统只需要使用像“键值对”的这样的存储结构，尽量使用hash类型索引。 优化器不能用hash索引来为ORDER BY操作符加速。（这类索引不能被用于搜索下一个次序的值） mysql不能判断出两个值之间有多少条数据（这需要使用范围查询操作符来决定使用哪个索引）。假如你将一个MyISAM表转为一个依靠hash索引的MEMORY表，可能会影响一些语句（的性能）。 只有完整的键才能被用于搜索一行数据。（假如用B-tree索引，任何一个键的片段都可以用于查找。我觉得可能意味着带通配符LIKE操作符会不起作用）。 索引、提交频率对InnoDB表写入速度的影响: 关于索引对写入速度的影响： 如果有自增列做主键，相对完全没索引的情况，写入速度约提升 3.11%； 如果有自增列做主键，并且二级索引，相对完全没索引的情况，写入速度约降低 27.37%； 因此，InnoDB表最好总是有一个自增列做主键。 关于提交频率对写入速度的影响（以表中只有自增列做主键的场景，一次写入数据30万行数据为例）： 等待全部数据写入完成后，最后再执行commit提交的效率最高； 每10万行提交一次，相对一次性提交，约慢了1.17%； 每1万行提交一次，相对一次性提交，约慢了3.01%； 每1千行提交一次，相对一次性提交，约慢了23.38%； 每100行提交一次，相对一次性提交，约慢了24.44%； 每10行提交一次，相对一次性提交，约慢了92.78%； 每行提交一次，相对一次性提交，约慢了546.78%，也就是慢了5倍； 因此，最好是等待所有事务结束后再批量提交，而不是每执行完一个SQL就提交一次。曾经有一次对比测试mysqldump启用extended-insert和未启用导出的SQL脚本，后者比前者慢了不止5倍。重要：这个建议并不是绝对成立的，要看具体的场景。如果是一个高并发的在线业务，就需要尽快提交事务，避免锁范围被扩大。但如果是在非高并发的业务场景，尤其是做数据批量导入的场景下，就建议采用批量提交的方式。 下面是详细的测试案例过程，有兴趣的同学可以看看：1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `mytab`;CREATE TABLE `mytab` (`id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,`c1` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',`c2` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',`c3` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,`c4` varchar(200) NOT NULL DEFAULT ”,PRIMARY KEY (`id`)) ENGINE=InnoDB;DELIMITER $$$DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS `insert_mytab`;CREATE PROCEDURE `insert_mytab`(in rownum int, in commitrate int)BEGINDECLARE i INT DEFAULT 0;SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0;WHILE i &lt; rownum DO INSERT INTO mytab(c1, c2, c3,c4) VALUES( FLOOR(RAND()*rownum),FLOO(RAND()*rownum),NOW(), REPEAT(CHAR(ROUND(RAND()*255)),200)); SET i = i+1; /* 达到每COMMITRATE 频率时提交一次 */ IF (commitrate &gt; 0) AND (i % commitrate = 0) THENCOMMIT;SELECT CONCAT('commitrate: ', commitrate, ' in ', I);END IF;END WHILE;COMMIT;SELECT 'ALL COMMIT;';END; $$$ 测试调用call insert_mytab(300000, 1); — 每次一提交 call insert_mytab(300000, 10); — 每10次一提交 call insert_mytab(300000, 100); — 每100次一提交 call insert_mytab(300000, 1000); — 每1千次一提交 call insert_mytab(300000, 10000); — 每1万次提交 call insert_mytab(300000, 100000); — 每10万次一提交 call insert_mytab(300000, 0); — 一次性提交]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[异类-一万小时定律]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-03-14-Book-10KHours%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[更新：这里的练习 作家格拉德威尔在《异类》一书中指出：“人们眼中的天才之所以卓越非凡，并非天资超人一等，而是付出了持续不断的努力。1万小时的锤炼是任何人从平凡变成世界级大师的必要条件。”他将此称为“一万小时定律”。要成为某个领域的专家，需要10000小时，按比例计算就是：如果每天工作八个小时，一周工作五天，那么成为一个领域的专家至少需要五年。这就是一万小时定律。 “一万小时法则”在成功者身上很容易得到验证。作为电脑天才，比尔·盖茨13岁时有机会接触到世界上最早的一批电脑终端机，开始学习计算机编程，7年后他创建微软公司时，他已经连续练习了7年的程序设计，超过了1万小时。 为什么是一万个小时？ “一万小时法则”的关键在于，一万小时是最底限，而且没有例外之人。没有人仅用3000小时就能达到世界级水准；7500小时也不行；一定要10000小时——10年，每天3小时——无论你是谁。这等于是在告诉大家，一万小时的练习，是走向成功的必经之路。 音乐神童莫扎特，在6岁生日之前，他音乐家的父亲已经指导他练习了3500个小时。到他21岁写出最脍炙人口的第九号协奏曲时，可想而知他已经练习了多少小时。象棋神童鲍比·菲舍尔，17岁就奇迹般奠定了大师地位，但在这之前他也投入了10年时间的艰苦训练。 在大量的调查研究中，科学家发现，无论是在对作曲家、篮球运动员、小说家、钢琴家还是象棋选手的研究中，这个数字——一万，反复出现。 这是“一万小时法则”被提出的事实论据。 成功代表 一万小时定律的成功代表大画家达·芬奇，当初从师学艺就是从练习画一只只鸡蛋开始的。他日复一日，年复一年，变换着不同角度、不同光线，少说也得练习一万个小时，打下了扎实的基本功，从最简单一万小时定律提法来源于《异数》最枯燥的重复中掌握了达到最高深艺术境界的途径。这才有了后来的世界名画《蒙娜丽莎》、《最后的晚餐》。 田坛飞人刘翔，我们只看见他在赛场上的风驰电掣，一骑绝尘，可是为了他在赛场上的10多秒的辉煌，他从7岁开始至今已苦练了19年，不知跑了几个一万小时，汗水流了几吨，经历了多少挫折和失败，才换来了“阳光总在风雨后”。 青岛港吊装大师许振超，能把吊装技术练得像绣花一样精细，丝毫不差，多次在吊装技术比赛中技压群雄，还多次打破世界港口吊装纪录。为了这“一招鲜”，他至少练了30年，苦心孤诣，练习不辍，足足有好几个一万小时。 美国游泳好手麦克．菲尔普斯，除了手脚特长的天赋异禀，他每天练习八小时，全年无休，这样持续五六年，方能谛造一人独得八面金牌的奥运奇迹。 写出《明朝那些事儿》的当年明月，5岁时开始看历史，《上下五千年》他11岁之前读了7遍，11岁后开始看《二十四史》、《资治通鉴》，然后是《明实录》、《清实录》、《明史纪事本末》、《明通鉴》、《明汇典》和《纲目三编》。他陆陆续续看了15年，大概总共看了6000多万字的史料，每天都要学习两小时。把这几个时间数字相乘，15年乘2小时再乘以360天，等于10800个小时。所以在海关工作的他，才能白天当公务员，晚上化身网络作家，在电脑前码字。 从台湾超级星光大道走出来的萧敬腾，15岁时学习爵士鼓，18岁时开始在酒吧、餐厅驻唱，每天要唱很长时间，跟好几个场子，时间最长的时候，一天超过12个小时。 知名武侠作家沧月，5岁以后开始博览群书，10岁左右练习写武侠小说，读本科和研究生的7年半时间，更是每天花上六七个小时来写小说。单是大学期间所练习的时间，就远远不止一万个小时。在练习的这些年中，她始终保持着旺盛的精力和浓厚的兴趣，从不会觉得乏味。但她深知，自己付出的也很多。 股神巴菲特、微软创办人比尔盖兹、苹果计算机乔布斯，在他们的专业领域，投注都超过一万小时以上，他们专注的阅读、思考、研究、实践，才有今日的成就。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[这本书的作者是美国前国务卿基辛格，相信很多人都对这个名字耳熟能详，在他的推动下，尼克松总统踏上了前往中国的’破冰之旅’,实现了中美建交，开启了一个新的时代，进而深刻影响了人类历史和世界格局。就是这样一位具有全球视野的战略高手，在自己90高龄的时候，将自己的毕生智慧和深刻思考，凝结成这本书，它很有可能是基辛格先生的收官之作和告别演说。 杜鲁门秩序：罗斯福和丘吉尔所设想的、杜鲁门总统于1945年创立的美国式世界秩序，给全球带来了60年的和平与繁荣，但它很可能会在我们有生之年消亡。 中国式秩序：在蒙受屈辱达两个世纪之后，中国开始走上预示着和平与繁荣的征程。1978年，中国作出了正确的决策，即开放本国经济和实现与世界经济的一体化。然而在全球多边论坛上，中国应该采取少出风头的策略。目前的世界秩序有利于中国。 新保守主义秩序：新保守派认为，由于美国的国力巨大，所以它应当按照自己的形象来塑造世界，并阻止敌对强国崛起。虽然伊斯兰恐怖主义是当前的威胁，但是真正举足轻重的威胁是中国的崛起。中国是惟一一个能够形成超过美国的GDP的大国。 本·拉登秩序：伊斯兰教在精神上是世界上最强大的宗教。正如阿富汗勇敢的圣战者所显示的，穆斯林是不怕战斗和死亡的，更大的袭击会随之而来。随着时间的推移，西方会感到厌倦和害怕，它会退缩。]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-03-06-Book-LeanStartup%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[从《精益创业》一书中提到的主要思路和脉络，结合在现实中使用的频率，精益创业提到的三个主要工具是： “最小可用品” “客户反馈” “快速迭代”。 最小可用品–是指将创业者或者新产品的创意用最简洁的方式开发出来，可能是产品界面，也可以是能够交互操作的胚胎原型。它的好处是能够直观的被客户感知到，有助于激发客户的意见。通常最小可用品有四个特点：体现了项目创意、能够测试和演示、功能极简、开发成本最低甚至是零成本。 客户反馈–是指通过直接或间接的方式，从最终用户那里获取针对该产品的意见。通过客户反馈渠道了解关键信息，包括：客户对产品的整体感觉、客户并不喜欢/并不需要的功能点、客户认为需要添加的新功能点、客户认为某些功能点应该改变的实现方式等；获得客户反馈的方式主要是现场使用、实地观察。对于精益创业者而言，一切活动都是围绕客户而进行，产品开发中的所有决策权都交给用户，因此，如果没有足够多的客户反馈，就不能称为精益创业。 快速迭代–是针对客户反馈意见以最快的速度进行调整，融合到新的版本中。对于互联网时代而言，速度比质量更重要，客户需求快速变化，因此，不追求一次性满足客户的需求，而是通过一次又一次的迭代不断让产品的功能丰满。所以，才会有微信在第一年发布了15个版本，扣扣保镖3周上线的记录。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[就现在，停下手里的所有工作，深呼吸。 仔细想想，你虽然忙，但真正掌控自己的时间了吗？ 拿我本人来说，我感觉自己大脑里有两个房间，而这两个房间里分别住着两个人。一个人的身份是总裁，一个人的身份是木匠。 总裁怎么度过他的一天？他们每项工作为 30 分钟，每天都在做不同的 30分钟工作。因为处理的都是事务性和行政的任务，所以不存在打扰思路的问题。总裁每天只需要坐在办公室，那些 30分钟的工作，就像俄罗斯方块不断落到你头上。而你也需要不断移动和填充那些方块，在各个缝隙里填满你的一天。 那么，另一个房间的木匠怎么度过他的一天？木匠做的是那些创造性的工作，他需要去自主思考、去创造，去建设新事物。而所有这些思考，至少需要耗费几个小时或者一天的时间。而在此过程中，即使一个 30 分钟的会议插进去，也会破坏他的全部工作效率。 在我们每个人在工作时间内，不仅需要做总裁，也需要做木匠。而老实说，那些做木匠的时光，才是真正让我们在工作中有成长的过程。但是烦恼的是，总裁总是跳出来打扰木匠。 哇塞，我头脑想到一个好点子！我迫不及待的想尝试了！你知道嘛，迫不及待！我现在要试！这会改变我，改变世界！但，呃！等等，我现在必须得开会去…… 不行，这种工作模式绝对不行。如果你想成功，如果你想实践自己脑子里的好点子，你必须去确定自己什么时间，什么地方，你真的会预留时间去思考你的项目。 这里有一项关于工作效率的一项报告。 实验室给两组人，分别灌输了相同的「健康很重要」，「你不健康会死」这种极其关键的健身内容。 实验人员要求第一组人员亲口保证，下周必须锻炼——每个人都保证了，对天发誓一定会锻炼。但等时间到了下周，只有 39% 的人真的履行诺言去锻炼。 实验人员也要求第二组人员亲口保证，下周必须锻炼。不过，实验人员进一步要求人员保证锻炼的详细内容，比如下周什么时间锻炼，在哪里锻炼，怎么锻炼，锻炼多长时间。而等时间到了下周，91% 的人确实按照他们所说的去锻炼了。 懂了吗？所以，你如果真正想做什么事情，就必须把你的承诺记录下来，记在你的日历上。包括要做的时间和地点，越多细节越好，因为只有这样，你欺软怕硬的大脑才会被说服：哦，这件事会真正发生，我确实会做这件事。 但假如，你一直想研究 AI 项目。你在日程本上写：本周五，就等着会议结束后…… 我就开始…… 不要这么写。 如果你真正想做什么，请去为它计划一个准确时间。永远不要腾出时间来做某事，因为你不知道中间还有什么变故发生。 而你选择做事情的时间也很重要。根据调查，个人精力能量水平在一周五天的工作时间中会有波动的。所以，依照能量波动做计划，显然是个更好。 这里是能量波动图: 周一：本周能量还算不错的一天，但你兴致也没那么高。所以周一适合做一些强度低的任务，比如设定目标，计划任务以及寻找材料。 周二和周三：本周能量的最高峰。如果这是一只股票，你绝对适合立刻抛售它。你应该把最棘手的问题、最麻烦的难题，头脑风暴、写作任务以及各种规划放在这两天。 周四：你的能量已经开始慢慢走低。这时候适合安排和参加会议，和同事交流——尤其是适合开一些需要你耐心而达成共识的会议。 周五：最低能量的一天。你不想工作。你想要周末。而这时候，适合做一些开放性密度低的工作，比如计划下你未来，梳理下你的工作关系，以及总结下本周内容。 小 Tip：永远把最重要的工作，安排在早上！]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[财务分析与决策，是清华大学MOOC, 肖星主讲，同时她还写了本书:一本书读懂财报，分享书中的一个故事: 会计界的一名老教授写了一篇文章，他在这篇文章中回忆了他过去的一段经历，这段经历正跟“会计是什么”有关。 在他上大学的第一天，他的老师就语重心长地告诉他：“会计是一门科学，哪怕是犯了一点错误，也不能算做好了会计工作。”于是他默默在心里发誓，一定要做一个合格的高水平的会计，一丝不苟。 可等到他读了研究生，他读研期间的老师却给了他一个不一样，甚至是完全相反的答案：“会计是一门艺术。做会计不仅要把每一步的加减乘除都计算得精确无比，而且要在会计准则的范围之内作出选择和判断，让它能够准确地描绘一个企业。”原来会计是一门艺术，听上去不错，于是他便下定决心学好这门艺术。 可等到他工作了，会计事务所的老前辈却又一次颠覆了他关于会计的所有概念：“你还太年轻了，会计既不是科学，也不是艺术。”这下，年轻时的老教授彻底糊涂了。既然会计不是科学也不是艺术，那会计到底是什么呢？ 要解释清楚这个问题，恐怕得再讲一个小故事了。这个故事发生在一家上市公司。这一年，这家上市公司亏了整整1个亿，老板急得团团转。万般无奈之下，他下决心要在账面上把亏损变成盈利。 但是怎么才能让1个亿的亏损变成盈利呢？这家公司发现，自己在银行有1.6个亿的贷款，于是这家公司的工作人员便想出一个“妙招”来：先用价值3000万元的房子抵掉这家公司欠银行的1.6亿元，然后再用1.6亿元现金把抵债的房子买回来。 看上去，这家公司不过就是用1.6亿元现金偿还了1.6亿元的贷款，但它却奇迹般地把自己的亏损变成了盈利，这是怎么回事呢？其实奥妙就藏在这价值3000万元的房子里。由于这所房子，这场还款大戏被分割为上下半场、两笔交易：上半场——这家公司用价值3000万元抵偿了它在银行1.6亿元的贷款；下半场——这家公司用1.6亿元购买了一所价值3000万元的房子。由于企业的利润表只受到出售资产的影响而不会受到购买资产的影响，因此，这个购买行为只会在该公司的利润表上产生1.6亿元的资产。相比这个房子原来的价值3000万元来说，账面价值增加了1.3亿元。扣掉这家公司亏损的1个亿，这家公司依然盈利3000万元。另外，在这家公司的报表上，也出现了另一个结果——报表上房子这项资产原先价值3000万元，现在却增值到了1.6亿元。你觉得这家公司在做假账？这很难说，它并没有违反会计准则。 现在再来想想，如果会计既不是科学，也不是艺术，那会计究竟是什么？其实，会计变幻莫测，它往往不是黑白分明的，它存在很多判断和选择，会造成很多不同的结果，会计是魔法。 那么，为什么看似枯燥、单调的会计会有这么丰富的内涵呢？为什么人们会关心会计作不同选择所带来的不同结果呢？答案在于，在商业社会当中，几乎所有人都或多或少地用会计信息作决策。企业的管理层可能会用会计信息来判断企业的经营状况，从而作出更有效的战略决策；咨询公司可能会根据会计信息来制订这个公司的咨询方案；投资银行可能会根据会计报表来决定这个公司的定价应该是什么样的；证券公司可能要通过会计信息来判断这个公司的价值是多少……所以我们会发现，商业社会当中形形色色的人都会用财务信息来帮自己作决策；故事中的这家公司也正是因为别人会根据它的财务报表作决策，才绞尽脑汁地把自己的亏损变成盈利。因此，通过分析财务信息作决策就变成了这本书的主题。值得注意的是，这个盈利3000万元的故事发生在较早的年代，有它之所以发生的特定历史环境和制度环境，需要理性看待。 读书摘要 一、四大报表1、资产负债表：又叫平衡表或财务状况表，是唯一一个描述特定时间点状态的报表。1）恒等式：资产=负债+所有者权益 2）主要分为五大类：流动资产、非流动资产、流动负债（短期负债）、长期负债、所有者权益。 3）排列原则： ①左区为资产、右区为负债与所有者权益。 ②按流动性由高到低向下排列，如资产中的货币资金和负债中的短期借款永远是在第一栏。 4）流动资产：是指在一年或超过一年的营业周期内可以变现或者运营的资产。流动资产周转速度越快，变现能力越强，资金链就越健康。①包括货币资金、短期投资、应收票据、应收账款、存货。②流动资产的周转图：货币资金→储备资金与固定资金→生产资金→成品资金→货币资金③流动资产的划分：速动资产与非速动资产、货币性流动资产与非货币流动资产。④流动比率=流动资产/流动负债，流动比率2:1比较合适，太高说明资金闲置、太低可能无法及时偿债。⑤流动资产周转率=主营业务收入净额/流动资产平均余额（即（年初+年末）÷2），流动资产周转速度越快，说明流动资产利用效率越高。 5）非流动资产：相对来说，占用资金多、周转慢、变现能力差。①持有到期投资：指有明确意图并有能力持有到期，到期日固定、回收金额固定或可确定的非衍生性金融资产，比如债券。②长期应收款：指企业融资租赁而产生的应收款项，以及采用递延方式分期付款、实际上具有融资性质的销售商品和提供劳务等经营活动产生的应收款项。③长期股权投资：指通过投资取得被投资企业的股份。④工程物资：指用于固定资产建造的建筑材料以及企业的高价周转件。（尚需加工建设的物资）⑤投资性房地产：指为赚取租金或资本增值的房地产。⑥固定资产：指使用期限超过一年的房屋、建筑、机器、机械、运输工具以及其他与生产经营有关的设备、器具、工具。（生产经营、≥1年）⑦在建工程：指正在建设、尚未竣工投入使用的建设项目，主要是固定资产的新建、改建、扩建，或技术改造设备更新等未完工的工程支出。⑧无形资产：指拥有或者控制的没有实物形态的、可辨认的非货币性资产。（专利权、商标权、商誉）⑨长期待摊费用：指已经支出，但摊销期限在一年以上的各项费用。⑩可供出售的金融资产：指初始确认时就被认定为可供出售的非衍生性金融资产，如债券、基金、股票。 6）流动负债：指企业将在一年内或超过一年的一个营业周期内偿还的债务。①短期借款：企业为维持正常生产经营所需的资金或为抵偿某项债务而向银行或金融机构借入的、还款期限在一年以内的各种借款。②应付票据：指因采用商业汇票结算方式而发生的，在制定日期内无条件支付确定的金额给收款人或者票据的持有人，包括商业承兑汇票、银行承兑汇票。③应付账款：因购买材料、商品或接受劳务供应等发生的债务。④预收货款：可以视作短期融资的一种，主要针对紧缺商品。⑤应付工资：可视作企业对员工的一种负债。⑥应交税金：指应交尚未交的各项税金，如增值税、消费税、营业税、所得税、资源税、土地增值税、城市维护建设税、个税等。⑦应付利润：按协议需支付给投资者或合作伙伴的利润。⑧预提费用：指按规定预先提取尚未实际支付的各项费用。⑨其他应付款、一年内到期的长期负债。 7）长期负债：相对来说，数额巨大、偿还期限较长。 ①企业举长期债务，往往需要资产担保或担保人，必要情况下还需设置偿债基金。②长期借款、应付债券、长期应付款、住房基金，又以前三者最为常见。③企业的短期偿债能力是长期偿债能力的基础。 8）所有者权益：也称股东权益或净资产。 ①来源：股本、投资后的经营增值（留存收益）、直接计入的利得或利失。②排列：实收资本、资本公积、盈余公积、未分配利润。 2、利润表：也叫损益表，是反映企业在一定的会计期间内生产经营成果的会计报表，表现为盈利或亏损。1）恒等式：利润=收入-费用 2）营业收入：①营业收入=主营业务收入+其它业务收入②销售收入净额=营业收入-销售退回及折让 3）营业成本：也成为运营成本，指企业所销售商品或提供劳务的成本。①营业成本=主营业务成本+其他业务成本②商品流通企业，销售成本往往构成营业成本的主体，销售成本=期初存货+本期进货+本期进货运费-期末存货 4）营业毛利：①营业毛利=营业收入-营业成本②营业毛利率=营业毛利/营业收入净额，反映获取毛利的能力。 5）营业费用：也称产品销售费用，是商品销售过程中发生的各种费用。 6）期间费用：期间费用是指企业本期发生的、不能直接或间接归入营业成本，而是直接计入当期损益的各项费用。 包括销售费用、管理费用、财务费用。 7）营业利润：指企业的税前利润，为缴纳所得税的依据。营业利润=营业毛利（营业收入-营业成本）-营业税金及附加-期间费用（销售费用+财务费用+管理费用）-资产减值损失+公允价值变动净收益（或净损失）+投资净收益（或净损失） 8）营业外利润：企业经营副业所带来的利润①营业外利润=营业外收入-营业外费用②营业外收入=利息收入+处置固定资产收益+技术服务收入+其他收入③营业外费用=按权益法认定之投资净损+利息费用+处置固定资产损失+兑换净损+灾害损失净额+其他损失 9）税前利润：也称之为利润总额，税前利润=营业利润+营业外利润 10）税后利润：一般称为净利润或净收入①净利润=利润总额-所得税费用②净利润=利润总额×（1-所得税率）③所得税率：一般企业为25%，小微企业为20%，国家高新技术企业为15%。 11）每股收益：也叫每股盈余，每股收益=本期净利润/股份总数 3、现金流量表：在一定会计期间现金和现金等价物流入与流出的报表。现金流量净额=流入额-流出额1）经营活动现金流：①直接法：列出流入与流出的主要类别；②间接法：调整当期去的的净利润，并损益某些项目。 2）投资活动现金流：企业对长期资产的构建与处置产生的现金流量。 3）筹资活动现金流：指导致企业资本及债务规模和构成发生变化的活动所产生的现金流量。 4、股东权益变动表：也可以称为所有者权益变动表，反应构成所有者权益的各组成部分当期的增减变动情况的报表。1）资本公积：超过企业注册资本的金额以及直接计入所有者权益的利得和损失，及股本溢价+利得和损失。①资本溢价：企业收到投资者超出其占有股本的部分，原因为溢价或超额缴纳资本。②分类： A、可用于直接转增资本的资本公积，包括股本溢价、拨款转入、外币资本折算差额和其他资本公积； B、不可直接用于转增资本的资本公积，包括接受捐赠的非现金资产准备、股权投资准备、关联交易差价。③引入新投资者的出资总额=（实收资本+留存收益）×欲占注册资本比例/（1-欲占注册资本比例） 2）盈余公积：按规定从净利润中提取的各种积累资金。分为法定盈余公积与任意盈余公积。①法定盈余公积：按税后净利润的10%提取，当超过注册资本的50%时可不再提取。②任意盈余公积：由企业股东大会决议是否提取与提取比例。③盈余公积的作用： A、弥补亏损：弥补亏损的三种方法，后五个年度的税前利润弥补、五年后的税后利润弥补、盈余公积弥补（董事会提议、股东会批准）。 B、转增资本：经股东会批准，按股东原持有比例结转，且转增后留存的盈余公积不得少于注册资本的25%。 C、分配股利：一般而言，企业当年没有利润就不得分配股利，如必须分配股利，则需满足： a、弥补亏损后仍有结余、 b、股息率不超过票面值的6%、 c、分配后法定盈余公积不得低于注册资本的25%。一般情况下，经提取形成盈余公积后就不得用于向投资者分配利润或股利。3）留存收益：也成为留存盈余，指在经营中创造的、没有分配所有者而留存在公司的盈利。①留存收益包括盈余公积（有特定用途）和未分配利润（无指定用途）。②库藏股：也叫回收股，为上市公司名词，是指公司将发行的股票买回尚未注销或重新售出的股票，不能列为公司资产，以负数形式列为一项股东权益。 二、财务报表基本分析1、盈利能力分析：企业获取利润的能力，企业资金或资本增值能力。1）营业毛利率=营业毛利/营业收入净额×100% 2）营业利润率=营业利润/营业收入净额×100%①营业利润=营业毛利（营业收入-营业成本）-营业税金及附加-期间费用（销售费用+财务费用+管理费用）-资产减值损失+公允价值变动净收益（或净损失）+投资净收益（或净损失）②营业税金及附加：营业税、消费税、资源税、教育费附加、城市维护建设费。 3）净利率=净利润/总营业收入×100%，净利润=利润总额（即营业利润+营业外利润）×（1-所得税率） 4）资产报酬率=（净利润+利息费用×（1-所得税率））/平均资产总额×100%，指息税前利润与平均资产总额的比率。 5）净资产收益率（ROE）=所有者权益报酬率=净值报酬率=权益利润率=净资产利润率，反映了企业以自有资本获取净收益的能力。①净资产收益率=净利润/平均所有者权益×100%②平均所有者权益=（年初+年末）/2 2、经营效率分析：也叫运营能力分析，指企业对各项资产的运用效率。包括资产周转率与周转速度。1）总资产周转指标分析： ①总资产周转率=销售收入净额/平均资产总额×100% ②总资产周转天数=360/总资产周转率 2）分类资产周转分析：①流动资产周转分析： A、流动资产周转率=销售收入净额/流动资产平均余额×100% B、流动资产周转天数=360/流动资产周转率②固定资产周转分析： A、固定资产周转率=销售收入净额/固定资产平均净值×100% B、固定资产周转天数=360/固定资产周转率 3）单项资产周转分析： ①应收账款周转分析： A、应收账款周转率=销售收入净额/平均应收账款×100% B、应收账款周转天数=360/应收账款周转率 ②存货周转分析： A、存货周转率=营业成本（销货成本）/平均存货×100% B、存货周转天数=360/存货周转率 3、偿债能力分析：指企业用其资产偿还短期与长期债务的能力。1）短期偿债能力指标： ①流动比率=流动资产/流动负债，一般2:1为宜。 ②速动比率=速动资产/流动负债，一般1:1为宜。速动资产为货币资金、短期投资、应收票据、应收账款。 ③现金比率=（货币资产+交易性金融资产）/流动负债，≥1即可，真实的反应企业短期偿债能力。 ④利息保障倍数=息税前利润（税前利润+利息费用）/利息费用，一般≥5较为标准。 2）长期偿债能力指标： ①资产负债率=负债总额/资产总额×100%，资产负债率在40%-60%为宜。在不发生债务危机时，负债率高，则充分利用了财务杠杆。 ②净资产比率（股东权益比率）=股东权益总额/资产总额×100%=1-资产负债率，在40%-60%为宜。 A、权益系数=1/净资产比率=资产总额/股东权益=1+总负债/股东权益=1+产权比率 B、产权比率=总负债/股东权益，≤1为宜。 C、财务杠杆：当资产收益率（即净利润/平均资产总额）大于负债成本率时，负债经营有利于提高企业的资金收益率。 ③资本周转率（净值周转率）=（货币资金+短期投资+应收票据）/长期负债 ④清算价值比率=（资产总额+无形及递延资产总计）/负债总额，该指标越大，偿债能力越强。 ⑤长期资产适合率=（股东权益+长期负债总额）/（固定资产总额+长期投资总额）×100%，≥1为宜。 4、成长能力分析：也成为企业的发展能力分析，描述企业持续发展的潜能。1）销售增长率=本年度销售增长额/上年销售收入净额×100%，三年销售收入平均增长率=（本年销售收入/3年前销售收入）1^3-1 2）总资产增长率=本年总资产增长额/年初资产总额×100% 3）资本积累率（股东权益增长率）=本年股东权益增长额/股东权益年初余额 三、财务分析的高阶篇：财务综合分析，将运营能力、偿债能力、盈利能力、成长能力纳入一个系统分析。1、杜邦分析法： 2、沃尔分析法：1）对应公式： ①综合得分=评分值+调整分 ②调整分=（实际比率-行业标准比率）/每分比率 ③每分比率=（行业最高比率-行业标准比率）/（最高评分-评分值） 2）示例如下：]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[网上流传一份查理·芒格（Charlie Thomas Munger）的推荐书单。 其中有一本心理学著作《影响力》，芒格是这么说的： “这本了不起的书，解释了我们如何被他人操控，可别犹豫把它推荐给你的朋友。” 据说，芒格特别喜欢这本书，还向它的作者罗伯特·西奥迪尼（Robert B.Cialdini）赠送了一股伯克希尔哈撒韦公司的股票（价值10万美元）。 第一章 心理影响实验1：插队一个心理学家跑到图书馆，请排队等候复印的人帮她一个小忙。 “对不起，我有5页纸要复印，能不能让我先复印呢？”当她这样说时，60%的人答应了。 然后，她换了一种说法：”对不起，能不能让我先复印呢？因为我要复印几页纸。”她只多加了两个字”因为”，但同意的人居然增加到了93%。 虽然心理学家早就知道，当我们请别人帮忙时，如果能够讲出一个理由，得到帮助的可能性就更大。但是这个实验证明，只是听到”因为”两个字，人们就会认为她是有理由的，从而给予帮助。这证明了人类存在心理定势，会不自觉地受到影响。 第二章 互惠（Reciprocity）实验2：捐款信美国伤残军人协会每年发出很多募捐信，经过统计，18%的收信人会捐款。 有一年，该协会主动在信中放了一个小礼物（比如背面涂了不干胶的标签），结果捐款率几乎翻了一倍，35%的收信人捐款了。 这说明人们存在”互惠心理”，接受别人的礼物后会有一种负债感，觉得自己应该回报。所以，先给予别人一点小恩小惠，然后再提出请求，将会大大提高对方答应请求的可能性。 实验3：陪同参观心理学家来到大学校园，询问大学生们是否愿意陪一群少年犯去参观动物园，只有17%学生表示愿意。 心理学家换了一种说法，先问你是否愿意每周为少年犯提供2小时的咨询服务，至少坚持两年？所有人都表示不愿意。心理学家又问，那么你是否愿意陪他们去参观一次动物园呢？这一次，50%的学生表示愿意。 可以看到，让对方先拒绝一个更大的请求，会使得另一个较小的请求被接受的可能性上升三倍。心理学的解释是，人们不喜欢有负债感，当你拒绝对方的时候就会形成潜在的负债感，即使你实际上没有欠对方任何东西。为了做到不亏欠，人们往往会同意第二个较小的请求。另一方面，这里还涉及心理学的对比原理，因为两个请求形成对比，使得第二个请求看上去不那么过份，所以更有可能得到同意。 这种情况在实际生活中的应用是，如果你要向别人推销，就要先展示质次价高的商品；如果你要向别人借钱，就要先开口借一个很高的金额。这样会增加第二个请求被接受的可能性。 第三章 承诺和一致（Commitment and Consistency）实验4：看管物品心理学家在海滩上随便找一个人作为实验对象，在离他1米的地方，放下浴巾，很放松地躺在上面，听着便携式收音机传出来的音乐。几分钟之后，心理学家从浴巾上爬起来，向大海走去。 过了一会，一个假扮的小偷来了，拿起收音机就走。通常情况下，实验对象都不愿冒险去阻拦那个小偷。在20次的实验中，只有4个人挺身而出。 心理学家改变做法，在下海游泳时，口头请求实验对象帮忙照看一下东西，所有实验对象都答应了。当小偷再来拿收音机时，20个实验对象中有19个人挺身而出。他们追赶着小偷，叫他停下来，要求他对自己的行为做出解释，而且大多数人都会冲上去拉住他，或者干脆把收音机从他手里夺过来。 这是因为人们希望能够遵守承诺。人们在心理上有一种要与过去的所作所为保持一致的愿望。一旦做出了某个决定，或选择了某种立场，就有一种压力要与它保持一致，证明之前所做的决策。 实验5：公益广告牌心理学家假扮成义工，在加州的一个居民区内，挨家挨户地向居民们提出请求，希望允许在社区草地上树立一块超大的公益广告牌。 为了让居民了解广告牌竖起来之后的样子，他们展示了一张照片：一栋漂亮的房子几乎被广告牌遮得严严实实，广告牌上面歪歪扭扭地写着几个字”小心驾驶”。83%的居民理所当然地拒绝了这个要求。 心理学家又换了一个社区，先向居民询问，是否同意树立一块宣传安全驾驶的小牌子。这个请求不算什么，几乎所有人都答应了。两个星期后，心理学家拿着同一张大广告牌的照片，再来征求居民同意，这次只有24%的居民拒绝这个要求。 人们之所以对同一张广告牌，产生不同的态度。原因就是一旦人们之前同意了某个请求，后面的态度就会发生改变，他会答应陌生人的请求，努力与自己过去的承诺保持一致。 一般来说，当一个人公开选择了某种立场之后，马上就产生一种维持这个立场的压力，因为他想在别人眼里显得前后一致。而且，知道你的立场的人越多，你就越不愿意去改变它。所以，让对方信守承诺的最好方法，就是让他把承诺写下来，再尽量多地向他人展示。 第四章 社会认同（Social Proof）实验6：怕狗的小朋友心理学家挑选了一些怕狗的幼儿园小朋友，让他们每天花20分钟观看一个小男孩高兴地与狗玩耍。结果，这一做法使得怕狗的儿童发生了明显变化。 仅仅在4天之后，就有67%的儿童愿意钻进圈着小狗的围栏里，与小狗玩耍。而且当其他人离开后，他们仍旧待在那里，亲热地拍打或抚摸小狗。 这说明周围人的做法对我们决定自己的行动，具有很重要的指导作用。 实验7：旁观者心理学家让一个纽约大学的学生，在马路上假装癫痫病发作。 当只有一个旁观者在场的时候， 85%的情况他会选择去帮助发病的大学生。当有5个旁观者在场的时候，大学生得到帮助的概率只有31%。 既然绝大部分单独经过的人，都会伸出援手，我们就很难说这是一个”冷漠的社会”。但是，与一般的看法相反，旁观者越多，实际上得到帮助的可能性反而变小了，这是为什么？ 心理学家认为，原因至少有两个。第一个原因是，当有多个旁观者时，每个人的责任感都会下降，”也许其他人会帮忙的，也许有人已经这样做了。”结果，没有一个人帮忙。第二个原因是，每个人看到其他人都没有行动，就认为既然大家都不担心，说明一切正常。而且，我们都不喜欢在别人面前显得慌乱。 重要的是认识到，旁观者没有采取行动并不是因为冷漠无情或缺乏善意，而是因为他们不知道是否有紧急事件发生，也不知道自己是否有责任去采取行动。如果他们明确地知道自己负有责任，他们的反应是非常迅速的。 当你遇到危险，正确的做法是从人群中挑出一个人来，盯着他，指着他，直接对他说：”你，穿蓝夹克的先生，我需要帮助，请叫一辆救护车来。”通过这么简单的一句话，你可以让周围的人了解你的处境、明确他们的责任、消除所有可能妨碍或延误救助的不确定性。 第五章 喜好（Liking）实验8：足球队的称呼在期末考试结束以后，心理学家对亚利桑那州立大学的学生做电话调查，询问他们该校足球队上一场比赛的输赢。 如果上一场比赛输了，只有17%的学生会说”我们的球队”；如果上一场比赛赢了，用到”我们”这个词的学生就会增加到41%。 这种差异的原因是，人们对与自己相似的人会产生好感。因为没人喜欢当失败者，所以人们更愿意与失败者保持距离或差异。 第六章 权威（Authority）实验9：估计身高心理学家将一位来自英国剑桥大学的访问者，依次介绍给澳大利亚某所大学五个班级的学生。但在每一个班上介绍他时，他的身份都不相同。 在第一个班上，他被介绍为学生；在第二个班上，他被介绍为实验员；在第三个班上，他被介绍为讲师；在第四个班上，他被介绍为高级讲师；而在第五个班上，他被介绍为教授。 当他离开之后，心理学家要学生们估计那位访问者的身高。结果发现，随着地位每一次升高，学生们估计的身高平均会增加1.5厘米。所以，当访问者是”教授”时比他是”学生”时，身高要高出6厘米。 这说明头衔对人们有很大的影响力，一个人的头衔越显赫，人们对这个人的身高就估计得越高。这反映了人们仰视权威的心理。 实验10：闯红灯心理学家让一名31岁的男子在好几个不同的地方，闯红灯横穿马路。 有一半时间，他穿着一套烫得很平整的高级西服，系着领带；而另一半时间，他穿着普通的工作服。后一种情况时，并没有多少人跟着他一起闯红灯；而前一种情况时，跟着他的人简直是成群结队。 这说明，人们很容易从服装去判断权威。如果对方穿着一套权威的衣服，大多数人会选择服从。 实验11：按喇叭心理学家在旧金山的繁忙路口做了一项调查。 当绿灯亮起的时候，如果前面停着一辆普通的经济型轿车，久久不开，几乎后面所有的司机都按了喇叭，而且大多数人按了不止一次。但是，如果前面停的是一辆豪华的高级轿车，只有50%的司机会按喇叭，其他人老老实实在后面等着，直到它开动为止。 这说明，人们会从车辆判断车主的地位，尊敬拥有名车的人。 第七章 稀缺（Scarcity）实验12：品尝拼干心理学家让一些消费者品尝同样的饼干。 有一半人的罐子里有10块饼干，而另一半人的罐子里只有2块饼干。结果可想而知，后一半人对饼干的评价更高。 这说明人们对稀缺的东西，会做出更高的评价。因此，与其告诉人们将会得到什么，不如告诉他们将会失去什么，这样更容易对他人产生影响。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[所以,每个人都会尽其所能,运用自己的资本来争取最大的利益.一般而言,他不会有意图为公众服务,也不自知对社会有什么贡献.他关心的仅是自己的安全、自己的利益.但如此一来,他就好像被一只无形之手引领,在不自觉中对社会的改进尽力而为.在一般的情形下,一个人为求私利而无心对社会作出贡献,其对社会的贡献远比有意图作出的大. 17-18世纪的欧洲,一大批哲学家深入研究人性规律,直接催生经济学和现代社会科学,人性自私论则成为经济学的哲学基础.曼德维尔“私恶即是公利”、“人类所有值得颂扬的功绩和行动,背后动机都是虚荣和自利”等著名观点,对斯密和经济学的影响极其深远. 经济学逻辑方法的决定论、机械论和均衡论,追根溯源,则是源于人性自私论.人性自私假说是西方先哲对人类行为的最基本公设,是经济学大厦的基础.人的自私欲望无限和自然资源有限之间构成难解难分之矛盾和冲突.经济学应运而生,冀图解决这个特殊矛盾. 斯密《国富论》主要是阐释自私的好处.指出自私可以给社会整体带来很大的利益. 埃德温·坎南为《国富论》写了序言：“渗透整个《国富论》的基本信念,就是自私能够创造经济社会利益.自斯密之后,该信念遂成为经济学的起点.” 当然,对自私的最佳描述仍然是《国富论》“每个人都会尽其所能,运用自己的资本来争取最大的利益.在一般的情形下,一个人为求私利而无心对社会做出的贡献,远比有意图做出的要大.”]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[新资本论笔记]]></title>
    <url>%2F%2F2017-02-20-Book-NewCapital%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[生活中，我们常常会感慨物价飞涨，通货膨胀，货币购买力下降，房产泡沫太多。但其实，这些口语化的抱怨背后，是一个一般性的和世界性的普遍问题：资产价格涨幅总是比老百姓收入的增速快得多；虚拟经济的涨幅总是比实体经济的涨幅快得多；从更广阔和更一般的视野来看，虚拟经济、虚拟资本、金融资产的增速或积累速度远远超过实体经济（真实经济）、物质资本、人力资本的增速或积累速度。西方发达国家出现这个奇特现象已经有30多年了，新兴市场国家出现这个现象则是过去10年间的事。某些流动性金融资产（包括可买卖的股票、债券、外汇、衍生金融产品等等）的规模和价格的增长速度甚至还要超过房地产规模和价格的增速。而这些问题，正是作者在本书中所要探索和解决的。作者立足于开放的国际化大环境，从宏观和微观两个方面，深度剖析中国经济的发展国策和企业发展战略；采用全新的思路，深度解读对外资和跨国公司进行规范管理的完整思路以及中国企业如何发展的策略。全书分为全球金融资本主义的兴起、危机和救赎三卷，视野宏观，气势磅礴。 作者在书中提出全球经济“脱实向虚”的概念。它具体表现在:首先金融业增加值占GDP的比例越来越大。其次金融业的地位从实体经济的“仆人”变成“主人”，虚拟经济和虚拟资本主导和支配着实体经济和物质资本的投资和积累，货币和金融市场成为整个市场体系里最具有权力的市场。同时利率和汇率等最重要的价格信号与实体经济的基本面基本脱节，资产市场和金融市场的投机和预期决定汇率和利率，它们反过来左右和决定实体经济的投资和消费。最后虚拟经济和虚拟资本的积累速度远远超过真实GDP、人均收入和人均工资的增速，导致收入差距和贫富分化日益恶化 作者认为当今人类经济已经进入全球金融资本主义新时代。如果不站到全球产业分工体系、全球商品服务市场、全球货币金融市场体系的新视角和新高度，将完全无法理解当今人类经济体系所面临的根本性难题，更无法找到改革全球经济治理、实现全球经济持久复苏的正确方略。而这正是本书的出发点。作者在多年研究的基础上，全面分析了全球金融资本主义的起源和历史，论述了如何解决国家主权与宏观经济政策独立的矛盾，并探讨了全球金融资本主义未来的救赎之策以及中国战略。 作者在讲述资本主义的发展史时提到自1971年布雷顿森林体系崩溃以来的40多年，全球经济体系的内在结构终于从量变转为质变。以全球性货币金融市场、全球流动性金融资产、全球范围内虚拟经济与真实经济相背离为显著特征的全球金融资本主义，已经成为支配整个人类社会的经济体系。人类经济已经进入全球金融资本主义新时代。 然而现在流行的传统教科书经济理论仍是产业资本主义时代的经济理论，相信产业资本居主导地位，决定经济体系价格体系和分配制度，相信实体经济支配虚拟经济。但是在全球金融资本主义时代，上述一切皆颠倒过来。虚拟经济支配实体经济，货币金融决定实体经济的价格体系和分配体系；大宗商品价格被完全金融化，与实体经济供需脱节；企业不再追求利润最大化，而是市值最大化。作者认为之所以2008年金融海啸过去多年之后仍无解；世界各国采取了所能够采取的一切宏观经济政策，经济复苏却依然疲弱乏力；量化宽松不断增加货币供应量和全球流动性，真实经济的信用供给和需求依然萎靡不振；购买力平价理论和利率平价理论几乎完全失效；是因为传统的经济学家所习以为常的理论模型和思维方式已经过时，全球金融资本主义经济体系正以排山倒海、雷霆万钧之力，猛烈冲击着封闭经济模型和旧的思维方式。如果不站到全球产业分工体系、全球商品服务市场、全球货币金融市场体系的新视角和新高度，我们就完全无法理解当今人类经济体系所面临的根本性难题，更无法找到改革全球经济治理、实现全球经济持久复苏的正确方略。书中许多理论看似深奥而遥远，实际上，它与我们的生活密切相关，许多生活中的问题就可以用它来解决。读完这本书，让我在看待生活中的热点问题时，不会人云亦云，而是多了一份理性的思考。 当前中国，最有价值的不是货币，因为货币已经高达130万亿，而且还处于高速增长中，也就是中国不缺资本，但中国最缺的是优秀的企业家和优秀的企业，真正优秀的企业家在中国是非常稀有的资源，需要得到社会的理解和保护。如果我们放任高杠杆资金的恣意妄为，放任高杠杆投机资金的违法、违规，那么中国整个社会的企业环境将会急剧恶化，所有的优秀企业和优秀企业家都将处于高度不安状态，今天是招行，明天是民生银行，现在是金地和万科，接下来是格力，中国所有的优秀企业都会被高杠杆的投机资金一一斩首，这无疑是一场灾难。 资本都是逐利的，百亿级别的资本大战让人见识了资本的力量，很多人感慨努力创业最后都可能是为资本打工。资本如此强势介入，是否会推动社会进步，目前还是未知数。但可以预知的是，这一大战无论如何收场都会对资本市场乃至经济本身产生影响。在大众创业、万众创新的大背景下，资本非常重要，但如何善用资本是每个创业者甚至监管者都要思考的问题。 经济，金融，资本，杠杆，股权稀释，这些看似高大上的词汇其实离我们并不远，将所学的知识运用于生活，去解决生活中的问题，这便是最好的收获。总而言之，在拜读完这部高深的著作后，我觉得我看问题的视野拓宽了，分析问题的角度更加全面，我想，这便是我阅读此书最大的收获吧。]]></content>

    <url>%2F%2F2017-02-10-Habit-Communication%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[八部阶梯 + 四个技巧 成就你沟通的魅力 第一讲：讲述您会说话吗？说话需要训练吗？怎么练习说话呢？讲述的要点有哪些？讲述：很简单，就是讲一个故事，但是是片段。 注意时间。其实这里要求的是你有可讲的东西，也就是说你的信息量要足够大，那么这与你的记日记所培养出来的观察能力必不可分。 次序。要求你有很好的逻辑性，通观你想讲述的东西，然后心里排序，就开始吧。 提供细节。从小我们都看故事，其实很多故事脉络都差不多，但我们依然喜欢看相同题材，甚至非常类似情节的故事。为什么？很多细节吸引了我们。细节也是事实，这里考验的仍然是观察。眼不见自然写不出，写不出更讲不出。培养讲述：日积月累记日记 写读后感关键词：讲述 面试 谈话第二讲：叙述 什么是叙述？怎样让对方接受我方的观点？叙述有哪些技巧？关键词：叙述 结论 看法 观点 筛选事实叙述：相比讲述多了一个功能，就是你想去影响别人，让别人得出一个结论，最好这个结论是与你想让他得出结论一致。要点：完整的故事+观点。如果讲述过关，完整的故事自然不在话下那么重要的就是观点的提炼，材料的选择。可以发现的是，这里需要的正是思考能力。为什么选择这个材料？我讲了这个对方会怎么想？这个故事可以推出什么结论？是什么逻辑等等。我觉得这一步很像我们的口头演讲，或者我们高中常写的议论文。培养叙述：在讲述的基础上进一步思考，得出你的结论然后想如何去让别人也得出这个结论。方法上我还是觉得从笔头开始，锻炼思维，锻炼逻辑。看完书，写完一本书，一部电影后，思考我感受到了什么？为什么我感受到了？所以应该可以尝试写一些评论性的文章，比如书评，影评。 第三讲：表达怎样加深印象？什么是表达？表达有哪些方法？表达有怎样的效果？关键词：表达 非语言配合 道具 表情手势名单无声胜有声表达：核心就一个：工具。因为研究也有证实，我们获得的信息来源于口头表达的只有不超过30%，剩下的都靠的是我们的非语言沟通。如果你能够让别人记住你想讲的，那么表达能力就过关了。那么技巧就是可以使用卡片，肢体动作配合等。或是可以采取标新立异，但是不要太过。总的要点就是讲出你想讲的东西，并让对方记住。培养表达：尝试在说话时采用肢体语言 在开会可以尝试卡片形式 第四讲：讨论什么是讨论？讨论有什么意义？怎么有效地加入讨论？关键词：多人的沟通 发布信息 获取信息 改变看法 提问 事实 结论 逻辑讨论：讨论所强化的是提问。提问事实，提问结论，提问事实与结论间的逻辑。说起讨论，我就想起了上次无领导小组讨论，当时我们讨论的更多是结论，这是弊端。比如说在讨论一个救人次序的时候，我们说我们应该确立一个共同的价值观次序选择救人次序，如对社会贡献程度，年龄，性别，性格等等。接着在讨论过程中，我们就按照了这个次序选择。好的，很快，人数选出了，但是在讨论过程中出现的问题是不断地有对这个价值观次序质疑的声音，但是更改起来很麻烦，意味前面也要变，而且最后有一个人选是仅仅1票之差选出的。所以，重点就在于对共同价值观次序的讨论和让大家真正认同，而当时，我们花了很少的时间在这方面，仅仅2个人提出，然后其他人同意而已。应该让每个人都说出自己的想法。培养讨论：在小组展示，平时交流思想时 应用这些技巧就行。重在提问，实际上也是逻辑思维的训练。网络上可以采取的方式有加入一个讨论组，如知乎上的，或是在朋友间发起一个讨论。实战训练。 第五讲：汇报什么是汇报？汇报有哪些要素？怎样提高汇报的效果？关键词：汇报 高级说话方式 事实 结论 建议 因果推断 提高观察力日记汇报：汇报是更正式，而且重在提建议。叙述+表达+建议。叙述和表达前面已经练习到，建议怎么提？这里孙路弘老师指出基于事实和结论给出解决方案。建议针对的是造成该现象的原因。不难发现，汇报对于思考能力的要求更高，找原因，找到真正的原因正是要点，不具备一定高的思考能力不会形成好的汇报，虽然人喜欢归因，但是因常常归的不对，或者不是根本原因。培养汇报：锻炼思考能力，那就是多读书，多动笔，多思考，去形成好的建议。在看书过程中注意作者的推导思路，在写作过程中注意自己的逻辑是否有缺陷。平时可以看新闻评论，写现象类作文等。 第六讲：陈述如何系统性的说话？如何做到陈述？陈述有哪些技巧？关键词：书面功底 有层次讲话 有次序讲话陈述：孙路弘老师说什么是陈述？陈述是书面文字+表达。陈述是15min没有人打断你说出你的思想。对书面的要求更高。15min不间断，意味着你的大脑要不住的思考。陈述要注意次序和层次，这点与讲述很像，但是是正规化的，成文的，能够被推敲，毕竟陈述用于更多用于公开正式场合。培养陈述：书面表达必不可少，写更长的文章，写完之后，自己复述，就像一个更长的演讲去训练。 第七讲：解释如何分辨解释与狡辩？怎样通过解释解除误会？与人交流时如何做出回应？关键词：倾听 狡辩 吵架沟通障碍解释：在跟别人交流过程中，出现一些偏差是常有并且正常的。而在平时我们说话出现不理解的情况，更多的是光重复一遍，或者提供更多的细节再讲一遍，我们忽视了一个部分，就是对方的反应。同样地，当别人在给我们解释一件东西的时候，我们也忽视了自己的反应，光是点头或是说对，这样双方其实并不能肯定彼此都理解了对方的意思。正确的解释应该是按照老师说的四步。但是我发现第四步，确认对方听懂我了，在操作上不大好操作，因为这个要从我让对方去做来实现，其他的步骤都是我主动去实现的。培养解释：我觉得这一步并不难，不过是综合一下，提问+表达 实践操作吧 在向对方解释一个东西时，注意4个要点。 第八讲：回应不同立场的交流该如何进行？如何变被动为主动？怎样练习回应？关键词：对立 竞争 讲话逻辑回应：回应是一种对抗状态，解释更多像一个朋友，你们的立场，价值观是可以通过讨论来统一的。但是回应是立场不同的，双方利益不同，不能统一。相当于辩论赛吧，正是因为立场不同才有可辩论的内容。这里要点有2个，一是剖析对方的话。属于倾听。二是回应。事实不对或遗漏？结论不对？逻辑缺陷？培养回应：也不难，也是前面基础的综合。实际是倾听再加思考和反应能力。可以研究一下我们外交部是怎么回应一些问题的，或是实践操作。 第九讲：垫子垫子的技巧如何运用？有哪些垫子形式？怎样的沟通情况适合加垫子？关键词：缓冲对话 超越对方 cpu 沟通僵化 第十讲：迎合怎样创造和谐的沟通氛围？如何迎合？关键词：事实 结论同理心亲切感 第十一讲：制约怎样有效转移对方的关注点？如何合理运用制约的技巧，让自己在谈话中占据主动？关键词：制约 主动权 销售 第十二讲：主导怎样统一诸多意见，用自己的观点控制局面？如何提高反应和思考能力？关键词：主导 权威 占据主动 第十三讲：练习说话的工具（一）怎样使用扑克牌锻炼自己的说话能力？扑克牌工具如何制作？怎样按部就班地练习沟通？关键词：扑克牌 词汇 训练工具 写作文 第十四讲：练习说话的工具（二）怎样通过看图说话增强沟通效果？练习看图说话是如何提高提问水平的？在生活中如何训练？关键词：看图说话 对话 提问]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[正念冥想更新：坚持有1年时间，在克服拖延、习惯养成方面感觉相当有效！冥想5分钟 等于熟睡1小时 - 摘录如何熄灭贪憎之火，正直生活如何看破迷茫之雾，坚守本心如何洞见智慧之光，实现自由简言之他教授的就是道德、尽管我们也称之为注意力集中和智慧。这其中就是佛教修行的三大支柱，在我们的日常生活中，也可以称之为幸福的、心理成长和精神价值的实现。 推荐在喜马拉雅下载音频教程：输入 正念冥想 关注效率工作、效能生活的朋友们可能最近都听说了一个词—“正念”！ 正念（mindfulness）指的是“在当下时刻对周遭环境不带判断地保持有意识的觉察”，你可以从不判断地觉察呼吸及身体感觉慢慢延伸到不判断地觉察自己的所思所想。 其实这是一种观察自己的禅修方法，这种修行方法已经有超过2500年的历史。 正念冥想对拖延者特别有用！因为它强调：在每一个时刻保持不判断的觉察。 正念修行的整个要旨就在于轻柔、满足和滋养，正好可以对治自责的心态。 修正念可以培养你慈悲地观察自己的能力，给予自己更多柔和的支持，而不是严厉的责备，你会体验到更多稳定、平衡和被接受的感觉，而不是忧心如焚的焦虑或负疚。 想象一下，通过正念修行，你对自己的体验会有多大的不同，当你的心灵恢复平静，你又会怎样处理那些被你延误、令你害怕的事情。 正念冥想除了对心灵有巨大的支持外，它同样对人的身体也有很多好处。 正念修行可以提高你的免疫功能，减轻心血管疾病，降低压力反应。 拖延者一直生活在许许多多的身体和精神压力下，因此，作为一种有效减轻压力的方法，正念修行具有特别的价值。 需要强调一下：在正念修行中，不论你的念想是什么，你都要如实地觉察它们，觉察它们的来来去去，觉察它们每时每刻的变化。以这样一种柔和而警觉的方式来觉察你的念想，会增进你对自己的了解，这样你对自己就不会再像以前那么苛刻，你甚至会感到：光是感受到自己活生生的身体和心灵，就已经让你内心充满感激之情。 正念的修行可以通过正念冥想来实现！]]></content>

GTD的思想是来自美国人—大卫·艾伦，他写了3本书《搞定1. 2. 3》 管理的不是时间，而是自己，通过管理自己人生的目标，管理自己的习惯，甚至管理每天的行为跟目标的关系才是很重要的。 管理时间的核心是事件的分类事件的分类： 一是日程二是有截至日的清单事件三是没有截止日的清单事件 保持严谨，但不失灵活性。 《搞定1》书中，大卫·艾伦是这么提及的：大多数的人总是陷于日常繁杂的事务难以脱身，进而非常严重地阻碍他们集中精力去总揽大局。 所以大卫·艾伦的观点是：自下而上是关键！我们要从眼下的事情开始，获得掌控，然后再去逐步升级。 那我们现在来谈一谈如何做眼下重要紧急的事务以及紧急不重要也就是紧急的事务，如何快速把它们消灭掉？ 执行可以有4个方案： 第一. 你完成它；第二. 你推迟它；第三. 你可以委托；第四. 你可以删除掉。 这就是4D原则，第一个“D”是Do（做），第二个”D”是defer（推迟），第三个“D”是Delegate（委托），第四个“D”是Delay（删除）。 中国古老的哲学告诉我们：时间的本质就是当下，因为过去心不可得，未来心不可得，我们只能活在当下。 番茄工作法的作者把时间分成3类： 第一种是工作的时间，要求要很专注。第二种是休息的时间，要求我们完全地放松自己，可以很慵懒. 很自由。第三种是战略思维和全局观的时间，这个时间里我们就要在自己所有的事物当中去选择我们当下（或者今天）要做什么。 那么除了专注的时间和休息的时间，我们还必须拥有第三类的时间：也就是要有一个全局观的时间。 建议你每天拿出1%的时间用来做计划，做反思。 土豆，青蛙，番茄钟，两素一荤炖起来味道会怎么样呢？你的效率会非常非常地高！ 土豆，青蛙，番茄，也就是我们在线下课堂上给易效能的学员讲到的：收集-排程-执行的理念。 收集-排程-执行被称为”行动三角形”。 首先要把一切事务赶出大脑，把大脑清空，把脑子里的事都写下来； 然后，我们再按照轻重缓急把它们分类，跟特定时间有关的就写到日历表上；有截止日的事件要列清单管理；没有截止日的就按“情境”来分解； 最后就是行动了：应用执行. 委托. 推迟和删除的4D原则来对事情进行消灭，做到既严谨又不失灵活性。 时间管理的基础是精力管理 亚里士多德说过这样一句话：“优秀是一种习惯！” 习惯的养成是一次只做一个，每天坚持做，从你认为最好的. 最重要的那个开始： 秘诀之一：一次只能养成一个习惯！秘诀之二：习惯要每天做才能养成！再告诉大家一个秘诀：要想做到一件事，那就让自己爱上它吧！ 丘吉尔在25岁的时候说：他渴望自由；过了25年之后，他说自律很重要；又过了25年，在他75岁的时候，他说：自律就是自由！ 冥想的奇迹之旅冥想是最自然. 最有价值的人类活动，如果大家能够每天练习的话， 在心理. 情感. 精神的各个方面，你会发生惊人的改变。 时间管理的基础是精力管理。 而在一些讲拖延症. 自控力的著作中，它们都非常推崇冥想，这是因为他们认为冥想可以改变拖延症，认为冥想可以提升自控力。 世界上最大的借口就是“我有拖延症”其实“拖延”和“拖延症”，有很大区别。 简单来讲，线下人生就是由许许多多的坏习惯组成的生活方式； 而线上的人生就是由许许多多的好习惯组成的生活方式。 这样大家就明白了，线下的人生就是拖延的人生。 有一本叫《拖延心理学》的书谈到了患拖延症的四个原因： 第一. 对成功信心不足；第二. 讨厌被人委派任务；第三. 注意力分散，很容易冲动；第四. 目标与酬劳太过遥远。 这里有一个公式： U=EV / I×DU代表效率，E和V是分子，I×D是分母。这个公式可以让我们通过分析分子和分母的大小，从而帮助我们把拖延降到最低。E，是指对成功的信心；V，是指我们对任务和事情感到愉悦的程度；I，是指你有多容易分心；D，是指你多久会产生回报。 今天我们谈到拖延症的危害，严重的，可以杀死一个人，因为它与良好的生活方式相冲突，这样就直接影响到我们的人体健康。 拖延症会因为让你精力不济，从而让大家进入到更多的恶性循环中。 那么我们现在就来聊一聊拖延症的治疗方法： 治疗拖延症需要“标本兼治”，这里开出三药—然后三圈交际，运动和冥想，治拖最难但是效果最好的方法，就是增强自己的自控力； 一. 做快乐的事情；这个方法加强的是U=E×V / I×D这个公式中的分子部分。二. 专注，并形成自己的优势。做自己喜欢做的事情，简化自己的目标，少就是多，只做自己喜欢做的事情。三. 能服务到社会. 客户，以及身边的人。 先完成再完美很多人都有完美主义情节，总想好好地开始做一件很重要的事情，可是当你想着“好好开始”时，你却总是开始不了。 今天我们就要把大家的思想调个头，叫：烂开始，好开展，好结果。 一个有截止日的任务，如果我们能早早地动手做完它，我们就有时间去修改修正它，越修改越修正它就会越完美。 你知道自己的时间都去哪里了吗今天给大家分享一个很重要的观念：没有记录就没有发生。 柳比歇夫有一个习惯，就是每天只要是用时超过5分钟以上的事件，他都会在本子上记录下来。 大家可以在一天结束之际，通过回忆的方式去记录自己今天一天的时间分配，不过按照德鲁克的建议，他说，时间记录最好是在这件事正在发生时做。 怎样才能学好一门课程学习的金字塔分成上部和下部。上部：被动学习。它包含了：听讲. 阅读. 视听。上部和下部的过渡是：演示。下部：主动学习，在学习的基座上。它包含了：讨论实践和教授他人。 在被动的学习当中，知识在你身上的留存是低的；在主动的学习当中，知识在你身上的留存是高的。所以主动地学习和被动地学习的差距是巨大的。 这里想要给大家明确一个观点：一个知识只是听了，它的意义并不大，重点是要去实践，实践一次，意义也不是很大，大家要做的是持续地. 反复地去实践！ 最好的学习是教会别人。 科学地“重复”才能事半功倍艾宾浩斯记忆曲线的八大周期到底是什么结构呢？ 第一个周期是5分钟；第二个周期是30分钟；第三个周期是12小时；第四个周期是1天；第五个周期是2天；第六个周期是4天；第七个周期是7天；第八个周期是15天； 如果能够严密地按照这八个周期来进行学习，我们就可以牢记住任何知识。 所以大家现在更清晰我们上一讲的内容：知识学一遍没有用，要重复地，积极地去学习才有用，而且要按照艾宾浩斯记忆曲线严密地进行学习，我们才能学得更牢固！ 服务的人越多，你的效能就越大，教会别人才是最好的学习！ 天才来自刻意的练习！“天才”是来自刻意的练习，它决定了我们是不是伟大水平，而非一般水平。 刻意练习就是让我们永远在不熟练的地方，在经常犯错的地方练习，而且要大量重复。 如何避免做事只有三分钟热度为了解决这个问题，那我们今天就来讲讲—动机。 “动机”分为三个层次： 生物冲动 -&gt; 外部驱动(寻求奖励. 避免惩罚) -&gt; 内在驱动(能够自主地引导自己) 我们要去到第三层，叫做“内在驱动”！第二层我们就叫它“外在动机”吧。 内在的驱动对人行为的影响更大，外在动机对人的驱动力是下降的，生物冲动更是一时的！ 做正确的事是根本中国有一个成语叫作“南辕北辙”，这个成语很形象地指出了方向和方法之间的区别。 所以今天要给大家一个明确的观点：方向大于方法。 如何行动的话题我们之前谈了很多，那我们就来谈谈愿景和行动的关系。 GTD理念的创始人大卫·艾伦告诉我们：只有把愿景跟行动结合在一起，那才是人生的希望。 其实人生不在于做多少事，更重要的是你在做的这个事，是你自己选择的，是你自己愿意的，不要等到已经走到底了，才发现是错的。 什么样的人生最值得拥有有目标只是基础，因为目标还有正确与否的问题，还有值得与不值得的问题，不过前提是我们必须先有目标本身，然后才有不断修正的过程。 其实人生就是这样，它是由无数小目标组成的，它也是一个目标不断被修正的过程。 许多人用一辈子的时间在赚钱，却忘记了给自己规划一个值得拥有的生命。 寻找一生成功的因子 什么样的目标才是平衡的，才是长期对自己. 对人类有价值的，而且还会让你感到更幸福的呢？哈佛大学提出：核心目标是我们要建立成长性的目标. 人际关系的目标以及对社会的贡献。卡耐基也说：一个人的成功，15%靠能力，85%靠人际关系。中国的哲学谈到“内圣外王”。这四个字的意思是：对内，要成为圣人；对外，要成为王者。所谈的也就是大学之道：修身 齐家 治国 平天下。 成功的因子：快乐. 优势. 有意义: 我们要做快乐的事情，因为快乐才能持续，欲望不能让我们成功，快乐能让我们更持续，能让我们不断成长； 快乐到最后会帮助我们建立起自己的优势； 有优势不是为了自己，我们更重要的使命是去满足别人需要，做一个对他人对社会有意义的存在； 连接想法与行动的三个问句杂事不可以被管理，能够管理的只有行动！ 杂事与行动之间，我们要透过3个问题来连接，请你把它记下来： 要不要做？ 我要的结果是什么？ 我下一步的行动是什么？ 用反思三问清空爆满的收件箱我们要把收件箱清空，把每件杂事都转化成：我+动词+关键人+事情。 这时候我们的杂事和想法就没有了，有的都是下一步行动。 我+动词+关键人+事情，这个句式里面有动词，有动词我们就能很容易地进行相应的行动，并且把类似的行动组合在一起批量地做。 比如：打电话. 电脑处理. 在家. 外出. 委托他人……根据性质与情境，我们可以批量地行动处理。 要把大脑里的想法和杂事转化为下一步行动和情境清单，以及日程表，就必须经过这3个问题：要不要做？我要达到的结果是什么？我的下一步行动是什么？ 遇到大事. 难事了怎么办生活和工作中还有很多更重要的事情需要我们用“项目”的思维来完成。例如：生二娃. 环球旅行，为孩子找一个好的学校就读. 自己写书. 出书……当面对这些比较复杂的事情时，我们就需要把它升级成为“项目”来统筹执行。面对复杂的事件时，我们同样问那3个问句，只是第三句“我的下一步行动是什么？”需要反复不断地问，以至于我们会得到N多个下一步行动，直到事情去到我们想要的那个结果。 所以项目是什么？ 项目就是很多个下一步行动的集合清单，清单上的所有行动都要指向我们渴望得到的那个结果。所以，反思，明确意义真的很有价值，它起到了一个再判断的作用，它使我们更加明确自己做这件事的意义和价值，以及我们要去到的方向和要得到的结果。当对收件箱里的杂事明确意义之后，我们就能判断它是应该被删除掉，扔进垃圾桶，还是应该进入情境清单，或者是进入日历，亦或者进入项目清单，亦或者进入将来/也许清单。 其实，时间管理的本质是对事件的分类。 先有意义，再有条理！先有意义，再有条理！把杂事进行分类和整理，从本质上来讲是不可能实现的。因为我们大多数人只懂分类，不懂“明确意义”，所以大家的整理就仅限于把东西归归位。对事务明确意义就是要：删除不需要做的；暂时保留还需要酝酿的；待办的就放入日历和情境清单中。 管理学大师德鲁克讲：80%的事情不需要做，或者不需要自己做。 为什么要先有意义，再有条理呢？因为人活一生，事情是做不完的，我们只能做重要的事。 培养自己每周做检视的习惯 如何做好自己的月度检视？德鲁克曾在自己的书中分享了一个检视自己目标的方法，叫“回馈分析法”，这套体系在欧洲宗教界已经非常成熟了。 首先，他让我们列出未来9到12个月的目标； 然后，每个月都去检视自己在过去的这一个月中得到的成果与自己所定目标的关系。 梦想板与年度检视是一对孪生兄弟！成就一件事，我们只欠3点认识： 烂开始。有了目标之后，我们要从最重要的小事开始行动。 反复练习。烂开始但不能懒行动，在持续做的过程中我们还要注意不断地对目标进行修正与改进，每天让自己进步一点点。按照每周，每月，每年的“反思”架构，并且运用艾宾浩斯记忆曲线的8个周期来进行不断复习，我们就能牢记所有需要被记忆的东西。 以梦想为做事标准。我们牢记自己的梦想与目标之后，每天我们在选择做最重要的事情的时候，就有了标准。 影响人生的11个习惯！哪些习惯能让我们走向成功，实现梦想呢？ 冥想-使用正念·冥想的方法，早. 中. 晚个三次，如果实在做不到，那么当你要面临重大挑战之前，也一定要抽一点儿时间来冥想一下。 早起-很多服务世界500强企业的成功人士都是早起鸟。 仪式感-村上春树讲，生活中需要一些小确幸和仪式感。大家可以去探索自己和自己的家庭所适用的一些独特的仪式。 节俭-许多大富豪在生活中都有节俭的习惯。如果大家能在白手起家的时候就养成节俭的习惯，那么你会更值得人敬佩。 热爱自己的事业 -乔布斯曾经说：“你必须找到自己热爱的东西，做出伟大的成就，实现它的唯一方法就是热爱你所做的事情。” 阅读-巴菲特每天有80%的时间在阅读，他每年给股东写的信中都要推荐书籍。 打造自动化的收入-有名的人都非常注重自己的知识产权，他们出版书籍，把自己的品牌进行授权，善用理财知识等等，以获得更广泛的收入来源。 为自己打工 -如果你为老板打工，那么你就是在为老板付出自己的时间，如果你是为自己打工，那么就是在为自己付出时间。以主人翁的心态工作，让自己更有责任感，这样也能有更多的收入。 坚持锻炼-科学表明：锻炼有助于提升我们的精力. 记忆力和注意力，并保持思维敏捷，维持我们的健康，它能帮助我们睡眠，提高我们的工作效率，甚至它还是我们意志力的体现，让别人看到之后能够更加信任我们。 和成功人士交朋友 -成功人士的交往都是广泛性和多样性的，不是我们一般人三点一线第生活状态。我们要特别关注自己与他人的弱连接，不要仅仅停留在自己的舒适区，只与自己身边的强连接联系。 做慈善-很多成功的人士都是在一开始就关注并参与公益和慈善活动的。 推荐时间管理的经典书籍 《百年德鲁克》 《高效能人士7个习惯》 《搞定I》 《搞定II》 《搞定III》 《番茄工作法》 《番茄工作法图解》 《晨间日记的奇迹》 《善用时间》 建立人际交往中的“弱连接”！情感靠的是强连接，信息靠的是弱连接，这两者合在一起构成我们人际关系的要件。 所有的相遇都是有价值的，所有的相遇都是久别重逢。 今天世界上为什么Facebook马克会这么成功，中国的微信张小龙为什么这么成功？就是因为他们俩创造了能够连接我们弱连接的强大工具。 经营弱连接的4个关键！如何经营我们的弱连接，让它为我们的人生的成长以及工作. 事业提供更有价值的动力。 专长. 分享. 接触与反馈： 我们必须有专长，一家公司需要有定位，一个人也需要有定位。 你一定要广泛地去分享，量越大越好。 有效的接触, 有个理论叫12次接触理论 反馈, 它是建立在前三部的基础之上 连梦话都可以录的工具是哪个？易录 - 两个核心功能凸显了它的专业性： 第一个是可以在没有声音时自动停止录音，有声音了又会自动启动录音； 第二个是可以简要做编辑。 “天作孽尤可谅，自作孽不可活”的时间管理解读版！ 精力分为4个维度，第一是身体，第二是情绪，第三是思想，第四是精神。 当一个人没有精力的时候或者低情绪的时候，是很难有效率的。来自美国社会心理学家费斯汀格，他是这么说的：生活当中的10%是由发生在你身上的事情组成的，而另外的90%，则是由你对所发生的事情如何反应所决定的。换而言之，生活中有10%的事情是我们无法掌控的，另外的90%却是我们能够控制的。你控制不了前面的10%，但完全可以通过你的心态与行为决定剩余的90%。 情绪，越抗拒越持续！它的背后是你的信念与认知，正是这样的信念与认知，造成了你的自动化反应。 它有几个特点： 越抗拒，越持续。 谁不舒服，谁解决问题。 解决问题的核心，也是源头，即自己是一切的根源。 每个人都有一个自己的世界！ 事件. 抗拒. 信念. 自动化反应. 我是对的，这些是我们情绪的非常重要的来源。它的来源不是事实的本身，而是我们对事件的认知，其实就是我们的信念与认知的系统。我们谈一个很重要的观点，叫做事情是中性的，好坏，对错，美丑，完全来自于我们自己的演绎。天下皆知美之为美，斯恶矣。皆知善之为善，斯不善矣。故有无相生，难易相成，长短相形，高下相倾，音声相和，前后相随。90％我们是可以掌控的，这个掌控来源于自己对事物的反应。那么事件发生，你下意识的反应是正向的，还是负向的呢？它完全来自于你自己的演绎。 让我们永远在“线上”玩游戏！线下是什么呢？ 线下更多是负向的情绪，比如说批判. 担心. 指责. 恐惧. 抱怨. 比较等等。 线上则是爱. 和平. 喜悦。 也有的是在线上和线下之间，也叫压线，比如说宽恕。 我们不可能永远在线上，也不可能永远在线下。 所以我们的情绪永远是转化的。 我们的情绪能够从下到上，也就是向上；有时候也会从上到下，也就是向下；还有可能是维持不变，叫压线。 一切的发生都是为了成就我们自己！ 一切的发生，都是来成就你的，永远要感恩每一个发生。你要享受每一个发生，不仅仅是接纳，接纳还不够，你的情绪还没有到线上，当你享受了，你就开始往上走了。你说我接受都难了，还让我谈感谢？其实感谢每一个发生还不够，你还应该非常惭愧，惭愧为什么会发生呢？就是菩萨畏因。其实惭愧是非常非常高的一份能量。如果你还想获得更高的能量或情绪，可以做什么？那就是这辈子拥有一颗慈悲的心。一切的发生都是最好的安排，都是来成就我们的。 一事、一日、一生的视角没有反思的人生不值得过。 反思，是需要有层次的。 “反思”最常见的3种类型： 是对一件事的反思； 是对一天的反思； 是对一生的反思。 对一件事的反思： 就是用3个问句：要不要做？我要的结果是什么？下一步行动是什么？从而把想法转化成下一步行动。 对一件事的反思要秉承一个原则：要先有意义，再有条理。 当我们能够对一件事进行反思之后，我们就拥有了自己的日程和清单事务的架构，进而，我们就能对自己的一天进行反思。 对一天的反思： 关于这一点我们可以学习一下100美金钞票上印着的那个人物-–富兰克林他的做法。 富兰克林每天过晚十早五的生活。 他每天早上起来都要问自己：今天我要做些什么？ 晚上睡觉前还要问自己：今天我都做了些什么？ 我们所处的情境也在不断地变化，在可以选择的情境下，我们要秉承：要事优先的原则，首先处理青蛙事件 对一生的反思： 我们的人生需要有导航系统，而导航也是有层次的：最底层的是【跑道】，然后是1万米～5万米的人生高空。【跑道】里放的都是由想法或者杂事转换成的下一步行动清单。都是重要且紧急的事情，也是符合GTD的原理自下而上，是我们应该要首先去处理的、简单的，只有一步行动的事情。【跑道】里的事务我们要运用4D的原则：先做重要的，委托相对不重要的，推辞相对不重要的，删除很不重要的。在【跑道】之上就是【1万米项目】、【2万米八大关注】、【3万米目标】、【4万米愿景】、【5万米宗旨】。 在一生的纬度的“反思”我们可以问5个问句： 我要做些什么？这个问题可以用“对一件事的反思”那3个问句来回答，这个问题关注的是【1万米项目】上的事务，是近期要完成的事情。 我的角色和职责是什么？这个问题针对的是【2万米八大关注】里的事项。 我长期的目标是什么？这个问题针对的是【3万米目标】里的事项。 我理想的蓝图是什么？这个问题针对的是【4万米愿景】里的事项。 我为人的宗旨、世界观、原则是什么？这个问题针对的是【5万米宗旨】里的事项。 大家需要不断地变换自己的视角，聚焦思考反思自己要做的每一件事，自己每一天要如何度过，自己要过一个怎样的人生。]]></content>
